I've been wanting to read it for some time, but wanted to read Boyden's first book ""Three Day Road"" first.  As good as that book was, this one is even better.  But it was good to read Three Day Road first as it is a precursor to this one and helped me understand the characters a bit more.  Like Three Day Road, this book is so difficult to read in some ways because you keep waiting for the terrible, cataclysmic thing to happen.  And even though you know it's going to happen, it doesn't make it any less terrible when it does.  This book is also similar to Three Day Road as it told from the viewpoints of two different people.  Both Will and his young niece Annie have terrible stories to tell and each heals through the sharing of them.  I highly recommend this book, but I would suggest that you read Three Day Road first.  You will feel richer from the experience of enjoying superlative story telling.  Both books will take you up and out of your everyday life and into a magical world that seems so very real while you are there reading about it.","10 24, 2010",A1N1YEMTI9DJ86,"S.

11466,B002G1YGTC,"[0, 0]","Here we have a great premise for a series, with the retired schoolteacher and the small-town cop banding together to solve mysteries, and I appreciated the picture-postcard Maine setting as well. However, I think the book shows its roots as a first novel----it isn't badly written, but could use a little more polish. (And really, an editor should have told the author to remove just about every exclamation point from this manuscript---as a rule, I would say that novels simply shouldn't contain too many exclamation points---practically NONE, in fact, unless they're used in dialogue.)Now, this is a solid mystery, and not a romance---no love scenes here. And that's fine---however, I think a definite shortcoming of the book was the lack of ALL emotional content. It's as if the author is uncomfortable with writing about relationships. I've read other gay-themed mysteries that focus on a decent whodunnit while also delving into the private life of the main characters, and they've been quite satisfying. The complete lack of detail regarding the relationship between Jesse and Tim in this book is rather off-putting, actually, and difficult to understand.It's a great set-up for some decent drama---here you have two old school acquaintances getting to know one another again after thirty-five years. But the way the book handles their initial hook-up is baffling: Tim comes over to dinner at Jesse's place one evening, without Jesse even knowing Tim is gay---and then there's a jump-cut to the next morning with Tim coming out of Jesse's shower, and apparently they're now a couple. What the heck??! This would have been a great opportunity for a long dialogue scene which could have been played in any number of different ways. No, I'm not asking for a sex scene---but I would like to know how these two ended up together, what they said to one another---there is NOTHING in the text to indicate how this played out.Likewise, a little later in the plot Tim's eighteen-year-old daughter comes home from visiting her mother and finds Jesse at Tim's place. Suddenly she not only finds out her father is gay, but that he's actively involved with another man----great opportunity for drama, no? Well---apparently not---because once again this is never explored---we never do get to know what happens, how she reacts.So for me this is a problem---I'm not asking for the novel to turn into a torrid romance, and I have no problem at all about there being zero explicit content. But I would like to know a little more about the relationship of the protagonists, how it develops and plays out; I'd like a little more emotional content in the book, in addition to the mystery. So, as such I wasn't really satisfied with this in the end, and I'm giving it a mixed review.This is the first of several mysteries in a series, and I am curious to know what happens next---and if the author's writing style shows any development. But, I'm not sure whether I want to continue if the other books also ignore the relationship as thoroughly as this one did.","04 18, 2013",A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,octobercountry,1366243200

8264,B000JQUU00,"[21, 22]","Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""once upon a time."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. The dialogues, however, are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase, and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.","12 9, 2010",A36K2N527TXXJN,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,1291852800

11030,B000JMLHFG,"[57, 59]","Blanchard & Beecher'sSecret Societiesis a product of it's time.  It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the ""Paris Commune"", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence.","07 18, 2010",A50EGYZY7RHGI,"Brian K.

6260,B00472O74M,"[1, 1]","I read a lot of the other reviews before I started this book.  I was absolutely fascinated by the number of 'love it' and 'hate it' reviews, and how varied they  were, and I finally had to read it for myself to find out.  There was also the discussion about editing, and the errors that were rife through the book, with the author assuring us that an editor had been brought on board, and the book no longer has issues.In a 'light' fun read, I overlook some errors, and try not to dwell on them.  Life's too short to nit pick.  But I'm afraid more editing is still needed in this book.  I believe the author is serious about her craft, and wants to write more books, so I'm sure she will want to make sure her product is as good as it can be.  That will keep people coming back for more.As a story, there wasn't enough depth for the length of the book.  The story was fine, but long, detailed discussions of each meeting or encounter took up too much of the book.  I can accept someone getting that head over heels feeling at first sight, but looks are not enough to carry a long term relationship, or being ""in love"", and there was very little development of the characters beyond the ""mile wide back and rippling muscles"" and hair that smells like coconut.  And some details shifted somewhat in the book - Avery was 5'9, then 5'10, then 5'9 again.  I didn't pay a lot of attention to her physical appearance, but felt the author did not have a firm grip on how the characters looked either.  I like to imagine the characters for myself, but get thrown when the details don't add up, or don't remain consistent. Many times, I had an impression the heroine was a tiny, petite girl, (with an a cup bra size) but then a height of 5' 9"" (or 10"") and size 9.5 shoes isn't petite at all. And how many shades of brown can one head of hair be?There were spots where it looks like an attempt at editing was made, and corrected text was inserted, but not all of the old text was removed.  I do think the author has potential.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have attempted to pinpoint the things about this book that kept it from earning a higher rating from me. Another round of editing could easily bring the grade up another point or two.  The author does have a talent for descriptive scenes, and the reader will feel they are part of them.  But technical errors distract, and jar me back to reality, spoiling the effect of the scene she had spun.  I feel this author will take reader feedback, and continue towards excellence.","02 21, 2012",A39I3A6HUG5ZVO,Cici,1329782400

Nate has escaped, and Joe Nash, like any good werewolf protecting his mate, will go to any length to keep The Teacher away from him.It's a well-written tale with some twists and turns and wonderfully developed characters. It's sexy, sweet and introduces a whole new world in the werewolf/shifter genre. While the book does have some good action scenes in it, the action scenes aren't fleshed out fully enough to have the situations feel as threatening as they could.

I read this story first over fifty years ago while it was being held between the hardback bindings of a library book in conjunction with Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and In Search of the Castaways.  After I discovered how exciting Jules Verne's writings truly were I started reading all of his books that I could find and I most certainty appreciated every one of them.  When I saw ""The Mysterious Island"" in eBook format on Amazon I simply had to have a copy.  It is now my desire to acquire all the books that I have read and the books I now have in my personal hard-copy library, in the eBook format.  Even though we have grown up reading hardback and paperback books, enjoying the smell of printer's ink and experiencing the feeling of a good binding and fine paper in our hands, we no longer are able to collect them in their original format due to lack of available shelf space.  I have discovered that being able to carry all of my books around in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is not a bad way to go after all.  Hunting through book shelf after book shelf for a novel or digging through box after box of books which we had to place in storage because our books were completely taking over our home, looking for just the right book, has unfortunately become unrealistic.

But she has to go alone...or else. Her friend Val has been gone a month with no clues to her whereabouts. As the first lead, she's determined not to screw it up. So she goes, and meets one of the sexiest men alive.Sin-Bad Stoner is an old vampire who believes he's finally found the one woman who can fulfill his every need and desire. Unbeknownst to her, the brown-skinned beauty has been the subject of all his thoughts and efforts for a long time and it looks like those efforts are finally paying off.  However, she's not about to surrender quietly. So he'll just use all his vampiric wiles to lure her to his home and dominate her until she does.As a reviewer and as a reader, I've long loved everything vampire and everything BDSM:  The darker and edgier the better. When I saw this book contained both those subjects, I was intrigued. After all, what could be more compelling than an uber dominant vampire?  There were references in the story that Sin did not use any mind tricks to compel Chandra to remain with him that first night, or to like the sex they shared. But it did seem, all the same, that she was trying to fight her natural inclination to get away from him.Sin was not a very likeable character, sad to say. All throughout the story, he waxed on and on about the size of his package, but it was actually difficult to discern which was larger: that, or his unbelievably inconsiderate arrogance. On the one hand, he anonymously sent Chandra gifts before they met, so one would think his desire was to romance her. But then, after they met, he expected her to automatically capitulate blindly to his whims and desires. At one point, he even demanded she eschew all her thoughts of upholding the law as was her credo as a police officer and blindly submit to his dominance. And when she wouldn't do what he asked, he would toss her declarations of love back in her face, saying that she would do it if she loved him, reminding me of a petulant school bully, rather than a dark and intense vampire regardless of his origins.With Sin's two other sexy brothers, and a delicious premise, I really wanted to like Night of Sin but I just couldn't get past his boorishness to like the rest of the story. Because it had such promise, I find myself wanting to read other works by Marilyn Lee. I refuse to give up on this author after one read. After all, others might enjoy it, but I'd recommend giving it a pass.","01 17, 2012",ATNPFCCWHQWJJ,"Bella March ""Bookaholic, Book Reviewer""",1326758400

Justin Garrett is her traveling companion and associate at the law firm.  If they didn't work together, she'd definitely do him. On the plane she boldly masturbates in the seat next to him while he's supposedly napping, but he hears everything and it makes him hard. Before they left for this trip, he accidentally found a racy email to her friend on her laptop, and he knows she wants him and he knows her deepest, darkest desires. He plans to do something about it in Hawaii.They meet with their client, Mitch Magruder, who Justin apprenticed with before going to his current job. Mitch and Justin share a friendly camaraderie, and Justin knows he can count on Mitch to help fulfill Amy's fantasy. Between the two of them, they work to get Amy to relax and unwind. But can Justin get her to relax enough to give him her heart?In Unwrapped, Jaci Burton paints a vivid picture of the two men coaxing Amy into letting herself go, and letting them both seduce her. Readers will enjoy a molten-hot m&eacute;nage scene and the exquisite feeling of finally being intimate with someone you've fantasized about for years. As with all of Ms. Burton's books, this is power packed with emotion and sensuality. I love her style and how she creates believable, intelligent characters.

11037,B002AJ7X2C,"[0, 0]","Serial is a short story that tells a thrilling tale of what happens when two serial killers meet unknowingly.  One of the serial killers is a man, appearing to be elderly and harmless, who preys on innocent hitchhikers; the other is an innocent-looking young girl who plays the role of a hitchhiker, killing whoever picks her up.  The first two short chapters deal with introducing these serial killers and their very gory habits in murder.  The third and final short chapter has them meet up and finish quite an interesting story.  Now, know that this is a quick read, (you'll probably finish it in under 30 minutes) but it is still very entertaining, assuming that you don't mind graphic violence and murder.  The killing in the story is vivid without being overly explicit; to be honest, I found it to be pretty hardcore, but some readers may find it to be rather tame if they are used to extremely explicit stories.  Obviously, the development is amazing because of the fact that this is a short story, but overall, I think the authors did very well in writing this story.  Overall, this is a violent tale but also a chilling one that tells a very unique and interesting story.  I really enjoyed it, and I think fans of serial killer books will enjoy it, too.NOTE - In addition to the story in this ebook (which really only takes up about 2/3 of the ebook) there is an included interview with the two authors interviewing each other and two excerpts from books that they each wrote solo.Warnings - Mild Language, Sexual Insinuations, Very Graphic Violence","12 18, 2010",A3ANETCTMAN1NP,&#308;&#308;,1292630400

I was expecting to really become lost in this story as I have with other post-apocalyptic (kind of...) stories, but unfortunately it just wasn't a must-read for me. Until I got my kindle and started reading free kindle downloads I wouldn't really have considered not reading a book all the way to the end, but book got very close to being deleted before the end. The thing was, every time I started feeling like I just didn't want to read any more something would happen that would draw me back in enough to keep me reading. In the end I actually did get some level of enjoyment out of reading this book because by the end I was unhappy that there wasn't more of it to read. A good part of this was probably because of the questions that were left unanswered.The story is about a group of elitist people in a city who decide to start their own invitation only city....by building it directly on top of the city that's already there. The author doesn't do a great job of describing exactly how this works though (stilts? support columns? what???), and doesn't explain at all how what is going on with this city relates to what is happening in other places around the world. Is this the only city like this or are there more?I could have gotten over all the left out logistical details about the city seeing as the book was free and I eventually found myself mildly entertained, but the character of Malcolm would have been better left out. Adding Malcolm into this story added a sci-fi element that just did not mesh at all with the rest of the story.

I'll admit right now that I'm not a big fan of hitman novels, but the character of hitman Frank Jolino was so finely drawn that I was hooked within the first few pages.I'd love to see Jolino in other books because he was intelligent, articulate, droll, and at ease in his own skin. He also surprised me because he had a moral compass. Add all that to the fact that he was a vintage mystery reader, and you get a guy who is complex, appealing, and likable. Oh, yeah, he kills people for a living, but they're by no means innocents undeserving of being whacked, but Merz lets the reader draw that conclusion. He doesn't state the obvious and then hammer it home.Less likable is Ernst Stahl, once an idealist radical and now a jaded assassin, despite constant reminders from Stahl's character that he was completing a job only to save his son. His moral compass is stuck on ""anything goes in the name of paternal love.""When the two end up in some odd paranormal mutual awareness of each other, it's interesting albeit rather unbelievable, but the compelling character of Frank Jolino keeps the reader turning the pages. You probably won't suspend disbelief, but you'll be compelled to keep reading. You'll also be rooting for Frank to figure a way out of the mess and to, somehow, end up with the babe who has some surprises of her own.WarningI downloaded the book in February, and there are numerous ""glitches"" in the book. I won't call them typos because, since I publish ebooks, I know that they are conversion errors that occur when punctuation marks in a Word manuscript get changed to weird symbols when the manuscript is converted to different file formats like HTML which Kindle uses for their digital publishing. Don't let this deter you from enjoying the book.I advise you to ignore the Product Description because it's a spoiler of what are meant to be neat plot twists. Just buy the book.

Raphael keeps watch over the object of his desires, but never makes contact until Aleric is attacked.  The attackers leave Aleric near death, so Raphael rescues him the only way he can - by turning him.  But turning Aleric into a vampire only creates problems instead of solving them.  For to save Aleric, Raphael broke an unwritten rule.  One that may cost him the one chance he has at an immortal life with the man he loves.From Afar starts off on a high note with a tempting mix of longing, action, and vice.  Unfortunately, while Ava March hooked me at the start, my attention was lost less than halfway through the story.  From Afar is disappointingly unmemorable.  Raphael and Aleric were likeable and the sexual tension between them was laid out on the page, both basic elements of an intriguing tale.  Yet nothing in this story came to life for me, which was a pity.  Don't get me wrong - there is nothing to dislike about From Afar.

11672,B001NPDA44,"[3, 3]","For bargain Kindle shoppers this 2nd generation Belkin case may be your only bet as none of the cases or sleeves are cheap for the latest generation.  I, for one, didn't feel like spending half of what the Kindle itself cost on a mere foam square, so I went ahead and tried my luck with this.  Here's what I found.The first thing to note is that my only real need for a case was to keep my Kindle from getting damaged.  Form-fitting and trendy looks weren't really important to me as long as my Kindle was kept safe.  With that state of mind, this case does a fine job.  There is a clear inch or more on all sides, so it WILL move around which is a little annoying.  I'll be honest, it moves around a little more than I had hoped.  Nothing will be damaged because it's all soft n' squishy in there, but still, when I'm carrying it around I don't like it sloshing back and forth.  The most annoying thing though is that the Kindle 3 is much skinnier than the 2nd gen. so there's also a goodly amount of open space in the girth of the case.  What this means is that it will move around side to side, back and forth, up and down, against every wall of the case.  Again, no damage will occur, and it will do an absolutely fine job at keeping the Kindle 3 safe, but it is a bit irksome.  Not enough that I want to spend the 25+ on the correct case, but if I had more money to spare I probably would.~THE GOOD THING ABOUT EXTRA ROOM~As other reviewers have noted, that extra wiggle room can actually be a blessing.  Form-fitting cases don't usually allow any extra space for storing earbuds or usb memory or whatever other tiny gadget you may want to keep with your Kindle.  With this 2nd generation case, there's more than enough room to toss in an earbud or two without any problem, and doing so may actually keep your Kindle more stationary in there.~Also~I bought mine used, obviously, but fortunately my seller was offering the product brand new, which meant it came with a thin removable Kindle-sized foam shipping pad inside the case.  This padding was meant to be removed after purchase, but if you are using a Kindle 3 I actually think it might be a good idea to hang on to it.  The extra padding drastically reduces the amount of open space and actually makes the Kindle 3 fit almost perfectly girth-wise.  Side-to-side there will still be loose room, but with the Kindle fitting more snugly it will barely move around at all.All in all, I'm very happy.  I have an AMAZING e-reader that will now avoid damage as I carry it to and fro.","05 3, 2011",AY6A8KPYCE6B0,Tyson,1304380800

It worked well in this story, because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin, a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart, as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child.

Both are gay, Garrett is out but Kasey isn't. As the story opens, Kasey is back from an out-of-town game, and Garrett wants him to go out to a local club with him - Garrett has just broken up with his long-term partner and wants to go have fun.Ingram (Gram) Fletcher owns the Liverpool, the club near Kasey's home. Gram has had his eye on Kasey forever, but doesn't know if Kasey is straight or gay so he hasn't made a move. When Garrett and Kasey get to the club, one of their friends casually mentions to Gram that Kasey's in the back of the club and hints that Kasey might not rebuff advances from Gram. Then Garrett hints at the same thing. Deciding to take a chance, he heads over to see Kasey, and makes his move...and is rewarded with an enthusiastic response from Kasey.Kasey and Gram decide to get together again, and begin dating. Since Kasey is ""in"" and Gram is ""out"", it does make things a bit difficult. Kasey can't afford a hint of of the truth getting out as the sports world is nowhere near as accepting as Hollywood is, and rumors already swirl about Kasey's sexuality due to his twin being openly gay.When Kasey and Grant get together for a weekend in New Orleans, things don't go as planned and Kasey has to take a stand...My thoughts: First of all, you know I'm a sucker for any book that takes place in part or whole in New Orleans :) I really did enjoy Out of Bounds though. Kasey was a sympathetic character (I seem to always sympathize with the ones in the closet, I guess, lol) and Gram was understanding of his situation. I find in a lot of the M/M stories the partner that is openly gay gets frustrated with the partner that is not; that Gram wasn't pushing Kasey was a refreshing change.I had a bit of trouble with the opening scene - Kasey is very closeted and when Gram approached him in the club they started making out in public. I found that hard to believe, even if they were in the back of the VIP area. Except for that scene, though, I thought TA Chase did a great job with describing the setting and characters, and I could picture the events unfolding in my mind as I read along. Kasey's homophobic teammates were hateful and I was glad he also had supportive teammates in the locker room.I'm looking forward to reading his brother Garrett's story next - High Line.","04 1, 2011",A76OB6E2II5KS,"Loves FAB Romance ""Introvert, Worrier,  & res...",1301616000
6934,B000JQUU00,"[0, 0]","In my review, I'm more comparing how this book meets my expectations based on what I have read from the more well known fairy tale compilers like the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson.  Some of these English fairy tales are very familiar, but they are not always quite how I know them.The first impression I had was that this book is more varied in terms of 'fairy tales'.  There are a lot of folk tales, and silly children's stories that don't have any moral or resolution really (""Master of all Masters springs to mind, as a short tale that seems to have the point of reciting silly words).  There is also a fixation on the name Jack for a lot of these characters.  I just thought that was interesting.  I wonder if they are all the same person.  There is also references to King Arthur and his court which I found very fascinating because some of these tales seem grounded in realistic detail.  They mention Kings who reigned and real locations in England as having seen the events in the story.  It makes the tales a little less fantastical, even when there are giants roaming the English countryside.Probably the tale that most surprised me was the story of Dick Whittington which now I realize I confused with the French ""Puss in Boots"" fairy tale.  Dick Whittington's story is much less magical, and more about being lucky enough to have a very industrious cat who likes to hunt mice.  ""Mr. Fox"" kind of stood out to me for its implied romance, gruesomeness, and the confrontation by the heroine. There are not too many stories in this book that are the same ilk. And lastly a story that I was surprised to see included was ""The Golden Arm"" which I was always more familiar with as a ghost story.  But now I know it is definitely a very old one.With the more realistic settings, sometimes whimsical nature of a few tales, and the English slang that is used at times, this book of fairy tales is rather different from what I'm used to.  I find it very interesting to read the original of familiar tales and see how things have changed.  For instance ""The Story of the Three Bears"" is more familiar to readers as ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears.""  In the original story there is no Goldilocks - rather the intruder is a very disagreeable old woman.  This book is definitely worth a read, for something different than the usual stories and perhaps to find some new favorite fairy tales.","04 23, 2013",A1Q434SYE6K31Q,Charlene,1366675200

912,B0015Z7VWE,"[3, 4]","~* 3.5 Stars *~Lena and her four best friends run a production company in L.A. They're hip, trendy, and current, and they're building a stellar name for themselves in the industry by focusing on quality entertainment. She is always on the lookout for promising new clients, but never had that promise held more appeal than when three utterly delicious men walk into the conference room. It may have been the worst sales pitch she'd ever heard, but the apparent front man of the three, a stunningly gorgeous man named Luke, stirs all sorts of juices in Lena. Despite the waste of time the meeting turns out to be professionally, she suggests a further discussion between the two of them that night over dinner.It wouldn't have been difficult for the dinner to go much better than the meeting had, but even Lena is surprised to find out that above and beyond how attractive she finds Luke physically, she is even more entertained by his companionship. Their chemistry is off the charts and the sex is phenomenal. There is, in fact, nothing that could dim the exquisite memory of the best night of her life...until she wakes up, rolls over, opens her eyes, and sees a seven-foot tall, winged, fanged, shaggy monster in bed next to her.That's pretty much when the screaming starts.Convinced some monster had eaten her new lover, Lena is both terrified and pissed, and it takes a hurt and embarrassed Luke a while to calm her down enough to explain that he hadn't been eaten and he is, in fact, a monster. And that he and his friends had come to her company in desperate hope that they could help launch a preemptive campaign to prepare humanity for their existence without sparking panic and causing the relentless slaughter of the last of his kind.Hollywood: gateway to public opinion and recent home to a sex god of a monster. Lena does so love that town.I have to admit, a quick read of the product description of the book before I downloaded it to my Kindle gave me the impression thatLights, Camera...Monstersis a paranormal romance. I should've payed closer attention to the warning, because this is definitely an erotic paranormal romance. It's an important distinction; a fact made crystal clear when I wasn't anticipated it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I like erotic paranormal romance. But in this case, it created a few problems for me.It's not just about the amount of sex in the book, which is a lot, or the level of graphic description, also a lot. Nor is it the light kink, which was fine. It was the fact that all of those things combined and became the largest part of the story by far, substituting romance for sex, eclipsing an anemic external conflict plot thread, providing virtually no character development, and overwhelming the limited world building and mythos creation.The concept of the story is a bit kitschy and kooky, but it is definitely original. The characters were ill-defined and two dimensional, but endearing (especially Luke). There was more than one plot hole, but the guilty pleasure I took in the humor and random bouts of comedy kept me from focusing too heavily on it. And the external conflict was appallingly bereft of development and was so quickly resolved it was laughable, yet...I can't deny that I found it all rather entertaining.I had a hard time believing that the monsters call their species monsters, though. That bothered me a lot, and didn't make a lot of sense in the big picture. They have their own language and their own culture, have hidden themselves away from people, but they define their species based on human preconceptions and labels? That didn't track for me.Yet despite the drawbacks, I found myself oddly drawn in and more than a little captivated by Luke in particular, whose intense efforts to fit in completely charmed me more than once. I wish there had been more time allotted to Luke and Michael and Henry together, because their scenes were showstoppers. And I didn't detest Lena, which is definitely a point in the books favor.In truth, I wish I had started the book with the advanced awareness of its erotic nature, because I think my expectations would have been different and I would have enjoyed the read even more. That being said, I can't complain at the price I paid (gotta love those free Kindle downloads), and don't feel like it was a waste of time. In fact, there was enough promise and potential in DuBois' writing that I'm interested in checking out the rest of the series in the hopes that the smutty, sexual, lightly kinky fun shares the page with a more well-rounded and better conceived plot and fully formed characters.Warning: This book contains graphic scenes of sex and alternative sexual situations including but not limited to: light BDSM, anal sex, and monster sex.

In short she is a bee itch.After the second book the story became more serious and complex and with it my interest and enjoyment decreased. I don't know if this is the reason or because I didn't care much for the characters but the sex scenes weren't very interesting to me. I remember a few years ago when I got the first two books and they were great. But now I don't think I will even get anymore if there is any.If you like the other Dark Elves book then chances are you will like this one. Just try to ignore the heroine lest she ruin the book for you.","11 18, 2010",A311NMUKJ7S8KD,Ben H.,1290038400

There are places where the stories seem to drop off or change direction suddenly mid-stream.  ""The Little Brother and Little Sister"", for example, is missing a paragraph that is in other versions, which is needed to follow the plot.A few stories seem to have no point or plot at all, or added endings, although ""Catherine and Frederick"" is only a little worse here than in other versions I have found.  Most of the good stories are repeated in better collections.Only notable bits:""Bearskin"" is one that isn't in every collection of Grimm's Tales, and I found it enjoyable.  I prefer the stories like this and ""The Six Swans"", in which the day is won through persistence and cleverness. Also, he cheats the devil, which is always a nice touch. Many of these stories are solved through nothing more interesting than dumb luck.This version of ""The Frog Prince"" has a very beautiful beginning, but the rest of the story is disjointed, uninspired, and annoying.Overall it was very uneven, and next time I'll search Project Gutenberg for the full tales.","10 11, 2010",ARGCDQPW6JWQR,BlueFairy,1286755200

7728,B002FK3U0K,"[8, 8]","Whoever thought turning an iconic book into good smut certainly didn't pass the idea by reporter Jae Fields and he's pissed about it. Jae feels very strongly about the original gay coming of age tale and is determined to expose the comic writer as nothing but a heterosexual, female fraud treading on the honest emotions of gay men and their hot sex. What turns into a harmless crusade ends up becoming much more as Jae discovers the writer is not only a gay male like himself, but none other than the author of the original book. The web of lies increases with both men to create a touchy atmosphere as feelings deepen and Jae and Kelly must evaluate what is most important to them.This is a highly angst-filled story that uses the ""big misunderstanding"" theme not once but twice. However, the writing is subtle and deft enough to pull off both problems with only a slight annoyance at the inclusion of the second. The relationship and characterization of the men are strong enough to overcome this problem for most readers. The story at the heart is about two men who have a lot of fears and problems but overcome their respective mistakes and let go of the past to take a chance on their future, together. The emotional and sexual connection of the main characters, Jae and Kelly, is solid and beautifully drawn as the two struggle with their problems. Both men have problems and neither is perfect, yet the strong connection is enough for them to take a chance and risk for a potential happy ending.Kelly is the more dynamic of the two characters with his myriad of emotional and physical problems from an inability to have sex with socks to a potentially debilitating OCD condition. Despite these problems, Kelly has a deeply vulnerable heart, thrust for life and experience, and a kindness that endears him to the reader instantly. His shy needy personality is offset by a strength of will in overcoming his problems and fears when needed. Especially moving and wonderful is his connection and relationship to his houseboy and all around slut Will. Their dialogue and scenes together were the highlight of the book with humor, intelligence, and wit. They almost overshadowed Jae and Kelly's relationship but Kelly was always clear on his passion and desire for Jae above all else. Jae's compassion and understanding is essential in helping Kelly and creating a life with the complicated man and his dishonest mistakes stem from immaturity and poor decisions.I had some trouble with Jae's decisions and his inconsistent character with regards to honesty (or lack thereof), so I didn't connect or sympathize with Jae as much as I did Kelly. Jae's mistakes and hurtful actions towards Kelly could have been stopped but Jae refused to do so mostly for selfish reasons. Due to the lengthy time the story spends on Jae, his actions, and motivations, this led to an overall feeling that the book is good but not great. If the story had focused on Kelly and their relationship more without the trappings of Jae's job, the internal conflict is enough to hold interest but even so this is a good story. Most readers will enjoy the struggle and rocky path on the road to true love, even with the few missteps of writing and characters alike.

Frankly, in the beginning I did not like Nicolas. He seemed selfish and arrogant, and he was. Bringing Laney into the mix really caused this character to, well, get character. He became less abrasive and more compassionate. Laney was strong from the very beginning and I cheered her on as she took on Nick. She had to struggle to accept that love doesn't matter what color you are, it just is. Love Script shows you that love doesn't follow a straight path.

Once again, I was drawn into this small family and into their lives and loves.Ryland was beaten almost to death by his birth pack for being small and weak and then they left him to die. Unbeknownst to them and his new pack, Ryland is a Tri-Omega which means when he gets claimed by both of his mates he'll be able to shift and he will come into his powers. From the moment Gregory rescues him, Ryland knows they're mates, he's just been waiting patiently to be claimed.Gregory has done everything possible for six years to not claim Ryland. He's been waiting for him to come of age and be ready. So, when his Alpha's mate, Leyland, allows Gregory to see into Ry's heart and he realizes how much Ry is ready to be claimed and be his mate, Gregory wastes no time and claims him. Unfortunately, Gregory didn't listen when Leyland told him that Ry is &#34;just like&#34; Leyland, meaning he's a Tri-Omega and will have two mates. So now that Gregory has claimed him, they have a limited amount of time to locate Ry's other mate or he could die.Enter Viktor, Beta to another pack that Gregory and Ryland meet while on vacation. Viktor isn't so sure about this whole Tri-Omega thing and he's positive he doesn't want to have to share his mate. That's part of what makes this book so very different from the first story. Here there's literally three people who have to acclimate to each other on an intimate level instead of being lovers for awhile already.I liked this story as it was fairly unique.

He's a famous bounty hunter in Oregon in the 1890s who, when he shot the man in the saloon, just finished a years long quest to avenge his sister's murder and is now trying to figure out what to do next. When the snotty-nosed farm boy he just rescued from a gang of bullies offers him money to kill a man who forced him off his ranch, he reluctantly agrees to bring the man to justice, but not to kill him outright. But, first he needs to tell his sister's widower the news.Kyla ""Kyle"" Springer Bailey has been riding the trails and sleeping on the ground for the past month while trying to find Jace. She wants revenge on the man who killed her husband and took her ranch, amongst other crimes, and she's not so keen on the detour Jace wants to take. But she realizes she's out of options, so she hides behind her boy persona as best she can and tries to keep pace. When a confrontation along the way gets her shot and Jace discovers that Kyle's a Kyla, she has to come clean about the *whole* reason she needs this scoundrel dead and hope he'll still help her.The book has its share of touching moments and slow-blooming romance. Kyla, we find out, has good reason to fear men and hide behind a boy's persona. Watching Jace slowly pull her out of that shell and help her conquer her fears was endearing. Her pain was real and deeply-rooted and didn't just disappear in the face of his sexiness. Neither did his understandable aversion to marriage magically disappear after a round of nookie. Why would a man who's drifted from town to town for his entire adult life - a man who's killed his fair share of men along the way - feel he'd make a good husband or father? They're both the walking wounded and in a unique position to help each other, they just need time to realize it.However, while it was packed to bursting with my favorite themes - Old West setting, a heroine passing as male, a morally ambiguous hero, wounded souls, road romance, the kitchen sink - there was a certain...distance in the writing that kept me from getting carried away. Both characters were distinct and fully-formed and I couldn't point to any glaring instances of bland telling or anything, I just never felt really invested. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as it was an exciting trip, but I was watching them from far away. I definitely wasn't on the run alongside them. Add on a hasty and too tidy ending, and the book left me feeling a bit less than completely satisfied.I enjoyed the book, but I can't say it was above average. I'd still read another book by the author.Note: I read the re-released ebook version and noticed there were a lot of formatting errors and missing words. I had to mentally edit as I read for some sentences to make sense. It wasn't too too bad, but it was a little distracting.","09 2, 2010",A3HHXRELK8BHQG,Ridley,1283385600

Isn't the saying you will find you mate when you least expect it?  Well this is what happens to Adrian.  He thought he was happy with his occasional weekend date, thriving business and friends.  He found out differently when Sheridan Montgomery comes to town.  She is the former college friend of Adrian's best friends and has come to ask for help in the form of joining the pack.  Oh did I mention that Adrian and his friends are puma shifters?While Sheridan has been a loner since she was changed, she needs help with a stalker (former boyfriend) who has gotten way out of hand.  When she meets Adrian her inner cat tells her that he is her mate.  But, she fights it as she knows her stalker will be a death threat to Adrian if he suspects that she is mated to him.Can the pack help Sheridan with her stalker?  Will Adrian and Sheri be able to overcome the obstacles and mate as nature wants them to?After reading Cat of a Different Color my first thought, was ooh interesting, I had never thought what would happen to a were animal that was an albino, and the challenges they might face.  Add to this the dynamic writing of Ms. Bell, her alpha male characters, and a woman being stalked, and you have a winning combination that pulled me in from the first page.  I am now going out to find the rest of the Halle Pumas series.  I found that Ms. Bell handled the struggles and serious nature of stalking with the importance that it needs and at the same time was able to build a strong relationship between Adrian and Sheri.  I hope if you like were animal romances you will pick up Cat of a Different Color and I believe you will have an enjoyable read.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","07 22, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1248220800

9429,B001CN45IC,"[2, 3]","Originally Posted at: [...]Dark, mysterious and oh so sexy. Those are only a few words I can use to describe Trigg, a vampire who has sworn to protect civilization from the rogues of his kind.After escaping years of abuse from Jack, the last thing Robyn was looking for was another man trying to control her, yet that is exactly what she got. Who wouldn't want to take care of a starving, visibly abused female like Robyn? Trigg only wanted to make her evening a little easier by purchasing her a real meal, but that one meal turned into a lifetime.Your heart will immediately go out to Robyn in this story. I was a little concerned that the love story was about an eighteen year-old, because that seemed a little too young in my mind but it worked well since Robyn was forced to grow up fast due to the abuse she lived with. I also enjoyed the way her previous circumstances made her adapt to Trigg and the other Watchers' way of life easily.Trigg, like many men in these types of novels, is your typical Alpha male. He would have to be in order to be a Watcher for his kind. Only around Robyn can he allow himself to show his softer side. So between Robyn's need for protection, and his need to loosen up, they come together wonderfully.The plot line was phenomenal. The way everything tied in together was perfect. The story was constantly moving forward and kept me turning page after page. It's one of those books where you say to yourself this is the last chapter I'll read, but yet you keep going until you realize you've read the entire book. It also sets you up perfectly for the next book in the series which I cannot wait to read.This was a great love story between two well-deserving characters that you definitely do not want to miss.

The raedjour as a people are dying. They've lost so much since their goddess left when Radin was trapped in the void. This finale answered a lot of questions and took the story in a direction I hadn't been anticipating.But first, can I just say, Eyrhaen was a horrible, narcissistic, egotistic BRAT of the highest order. I realize she was the first female raedjour born, EVER, but you'd think her parents could have done a little disciplining at some point in time. She was so horrid for most of the book that even when she started to come around and actually have a conscience I just could never completely warm up to her. Her three closest friends she tortured and treated like pets. That is not a princess in my mind!!Nialdlyn was back and in a somewhat surprising role. Having spent the past more than two decades with the raedjour she is a valuable part of their city and their people. It's absolutely no wonder to me that she and Eryhaen can not stand each other. And, seriously, that was fun to watch!Oh Radin. You've been missed. Without going into spoilers I can not explain what changes he underwent in the void but suffice to say the changes are huge and massively influential.There is so much that I could say but it would all be spoilers. So, trust me that this final book was really good. I had some frustration but mainly over some behaviors, although Radin certainly knew how to knock Eryhaen down a peg or two!

2935,B00436EZGC,"[1, 1]","This isn't the only book of this nature by a long shot, I just don't get it.Basically, the idea is that David bailed on Ethan years ago because he had a thing for him.  So, Ethan puts together an elaborate ruse to get David on an island alone.  Then, he tells David that he doesn't get any food or shelter unless he submits to his whims, and that he can't leave.The author kind of tries to paint David as conflicted rather than completely against the idea, but really - it shouldn't matter should it?  Even if some part of someone wants someone else, they should still get to choose.  And no, having food held hostage while the other person gets you worked up and then pretends your final acquiescence is consent is not a real choice.I can't figure how anyone thinks this stuff is romantic at all.  BDSM is all about the submissive partner having the power to put a stop to the behavior or the relationship at any time.  Once you take that away, it isn't games between consenting adults, it is just bullying and abuse of power.  Bullying and abuse aren't romantic, even when the victim claims to be OK with it.  I spent the parts of this book that I managed to finish feeling awful for David, who was being bullied into doing something he did not wish to do.I do wonder why we've managed to reduce the prevalence of rape fantasies in m/f romance, but people still accept it in m/m romance.","06 14, 2014",A3KQ4AAE1CUPN7,"Estarianne ""Fantasy Mom""",1402704000

Marc and Blake have been fighting demons but Blake seems to not see it as a responsibility but more as fun.  Marc is frustrated that Blake can't see that to protect the humans IS what's important, that humans are important.  When they meet Kate and her fellow human fighters while fighting a group of demons, they are taken back by Kate to the human compound, where they are greeted with not quite friendly faces.  Marc is intrigued by Kate, her boldness, her strength and by her beauty.  He knows it's not safe to get involved with a human and sees Blake's growing attraction to Kate as a threat to their very well being.  Kate is also torn by her attraction to both Marc and Blake.  She's distracted by them in the field which could prove deadly but she also knows they need Marc and Blake's help in fighting the demons.

This was the case with Sukie O'Leary, her brother Sean's friend Eamon Houlihan was that teenage crush, and hew was now ranked as one of the best goalies in the National Hockey League. What she didn't know is that Eamon had noticed years ago her growing up and the feelings were mutual.They all still had connections to the old neighborhood that they grew up in, in more ways than one would think.  The boys had been successful in both athletics in high school being able to further on their education by going to Ivy League Schools. Sean was now a successful Trauma Specialist and ER Doctor.  Eamon of course with hockey.  Sukie was being talked about as well now because she had ""cancer"" and that was something everyone whispered about behind her back and looked at her differently.  Which she hated, she wanted people to just treat her like they did before.  While Eamon had wanted to rush back and help when he heard the news earlier, he waited but he did vow to treat her normally.  But he didn't know just what he was getting himself into.Practice makes you perfect is something that we have all heard, well Sukie felt she was out of practice in bed and needed someone to help her, that person was Eamon on the condition no strings attached.  Little did they realize that there were strings and the heat they created with each other was enough to melt the ice rink that Eamon played on. An accident on the ice made them realize how much they did need each other.It was a good short story and did remind us that if you do know someone who has been affected by an illness they do want to be treated normally.

Now she's more than ready to retire, but before she does so, her kinsmen have asked her to fulfill one last assignment: kill Celino Carvanna.  It's a task that should please her - Celino all but ruined her life more than a decade before.  But even as she lays a sensual trap to break Celino, Meli can't ignore the hold he still has on her emotions.  When the opportunity for revenge arises, will Meli be able to bring herself to take it?Intrigue, danger, and romance mix together in this seductive game of cat and mouse.  Silent Blade is both exciting and fascinating, with two protagonists that would be the perfect match for one another, were it not for old wounds and new obstacles barring their path to happiness.Meli is a wonderful heroine.  She's brilliant and deadly, but her strength is balanced evenly with her femininity.  I admired her for this and truly felt for her when I read about how Celino's actions devastated her in the past.  As for her target, Celino is deadly both in business and with a blade.  His razor-sharp mind makes him a fitting opponent for Meli, but his ruthlessness is belied by his desire for her.

9288,B002I1XQ0A,"[6, 6]","Alexia Colton had spent every summer since she was fourteen visiting her grandmother in the charming seaside town of Jaffrey's Cove, until adulthood and the need to work kept her away. She loves the ocean, and always felt a sense of peace and home there, and was always enchanted by the dolphins that often play in the surf just off the shore. When her grandmother, a once strong and vibrant woman, now feeble and needing help to move into an assisted living facility, calls Alexia sounding frantic, Alexia rushes to her gram's side to get her settled. Sharing this time with her grandmother, whom Alexia can tell is starting to decline in health and mental acuity, is invaluable to her, and when Victoria offers her granddaughter her seaside home and a stunning family heirloom, Alexia takes the necklace but declines on the house. Her work is in the middle of the country, after all.Soon Alexia is having erotic dreams of the boy, now a man, she'd once met as a child, making love to her in a cavern she's dreamed of her entire life. And her gram is acting stranger and stranger...and significantly less feeble than she'd been when Alexia first arrived. The ocean is calling to her and her body is burning with unfamiliar hungers. Alexia's world is shifting and she'll soon realize that she's not as human as she'd always thought, mermen are real, and the dolphins she's loved her whole life are all citizens of Jaffrey's Cove. And Alexia herself is the new matriarch of their pod, with two gorgeous and dedicated consorts, the cousins Joshua and Anthony, to love her body, heart, and mind for as long as she chooses. What's not to love about life changes like that??I don't need to spend much time on the erotica aspects of Tidal Wave. The sex is sizzling hot and extremely well done. Arend manages a nice blend of emotion driven sexuality and explicit sex that's extremely satisfying and too rare in erotica romance. I also have to give her credit for how deftly she managed to keep the sex scenes (of which there are several...it's erotica, after all) from completely overshadowing or eclipsing the plot and character development. That's rather a nifty accomplishment in a novella length story, which tends to suffer in those areas to begin with. Also, I'm very very picky about my reading choices when it comes to menage a trois erotica, when I read it at all. It's not a particular favorite of mine and I rarely find menage done in a way that appeals to my tastes. Tidal Wave mastered that for me. I was exceptionally pleased with all sexual aspects of the story.The other parts had a few bumps of a less erotic kind. This isn't the first story or series I've read by Vivian Arend. I've read several of the Granite Lake Wolves, as well, so this wasn't too much of a surprise because I've had this issue with her as an author before. Arend tends to master the sex and the emotion of a story in very short order, but the plot and characterizations sometimes have issues, as Tidal Wave does. Some of that is the nature of the beast in a novella. I like the way Arend writes and I'm greedy, so I want there to be more meat to the story, but to have more meat you have to either sacrifice some of the sex or write a book. While I have high hopes that Arend will eventually write a full length novel, with her novellas, she has a tendency to skimp a bit on fully developing the mythos of the world she's built in each story. In Tidal Wave that was a particular shame, because I would've loved learning more about the merpeople and spent more time with them in their dolphin form. I found the concept behind the plot to be fresh and unique and that's so rare it should be fully explored.There were a couple of plot holes and characterization blips that got ignored in this story. Why was Joshua sent away every summer Alexia returned to Jaffrey's Cove after the first time they met and shared a sweet kiss when she was fourteen? He wondered but there was never an answer given. Why was he treated so dismissively by his brothers? Why did Alexia dream of the cavern before ever going there and before receiving the medallion? No one ever had before. Those holes were frustrating.There was no explanation for Joshua's sudden calm acceptance of his cousin vying for Alexia's affections when earlier in the story he was quite adamant about being her only. The quick turn around in Anthony's case, from him telling Joshua he wasn't really interested in answering Alexia's call to being all gung ho about consorting with her was addressed, but in a cursory way at best that felt unsatisfying. Michael's plot thread was a very nice conflict and it added some depth to the story, but it wasn't as fleshed out as I would've liked, lacked a real solid motivation given the defined mythos of the pod, and the resolution was lackluster. Victoria was a nice secondary character, but she wasn't used as much as she could've been and she sort of left her granddaughter with very little understanding of her people. You'd think the former matriarch would care a little more than just passing off a necklace before disappearing.I know it sounds like I'm being picky, but it's frustrating to find that great blend of erotic sexuality and original mythos with an intriguing plot and totally likable characters...then have a bunch of little issues through the story. None of that made me dislike Tidal Wave by any means. I hope I don't give that impression. I enjoyed the story...it's just I wish there had been a bit more. I know; I'm greedy. 3.5 Stars.","06 21, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",1277078400

In several instances, in fact, I found one guy or the other simply despicable.- Ryan's constant wavering about his feelings for Harley is enough to induce whiplash (and I do mean CONSTANT, as in he hates and desires and pities and admires Harley one after another, all within the span of a single scene).- The transition from ""Ryan hates Harley and is cruel to him"" to ""Ryan loves Harley and wants to live with him"" is incredibly abrupt. In fact, there's not much of a transition at all. He just changes, literally overnight.- The descriptions throughout the story are a little flowery and over-the-top for me. Here's an example: ""His face was exquisite, like an angel in human form. His lips were full and pink, his nose small and button-like. A pair of startling, amber-colored eyes fringed with lush lashes..."" And so on.Overall comments: There's a good story here, and it's actually one of the more convincing Gay for You stories I've read, but I didn't find it very enjoyable overall. The angst level is high, what with Harley's unrequited feelings, Ryan's sexual confusion, and both men's near-constant anger at each other. Each time I thought they'd moved past the hostile/cruel stage, they ended up saying or doing something hurtful again in the next scene.","05 5, 2011",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T. Anchor,1304553600

Carson has always been known to be wild and a playboy, never having relationships except one night stands.  During his best friend's bachelor party, he was starting to feel nostalgic and began to think about his own life and how perhaps it was time to tame his wild ways and settle down.  While talking to his friend, a beautiful brunette comes over and asks him and his friends to take her dancing.  He jumps at the opportunity to dance with Holly. During their dance, the attraction is incredible between them and they indulge in one fantastic one night stand in the club's storage closet.  Holly leaves right after their hot encounter and leaves Carson dumbfounded.  A month later, they run into each other at a wedding and they both couldn't forget their best sex ever experience in the closet.  He wants to start dating her, only problem is Holly is not looking for a relationship at the time.  Holly was still mending a broken heart, was busy with school, work and family obligations.  She just wanted sex and he turned her down.  He changes his mind and finds her, he is hoping to sleep with her and then slowly charm his way into her life.  Things were not going according to plan and soon Carson finds himself out of Holly's life.This story was short, sweet, fun and full of sexiness. It is not meant to be a full novel, but it is complete with everything I am looking for in a quick read: romance, steamy scenes and humor.

I liked the fact that Gram didn't know if Kasey was gay and he had all the worries of a teenager who doesn't know if he has a chance with his love interest or not. Their first kiss on the couch of a nightclub, stealing a moment in a dark, was beautiful and hot and sweet at the same time. It was a promise that wasn't really fulfilled.After that there's a lot of sex and the plot (young sport star who has to decide whether to stay in the closet and keep his endorsements or to come out and face the consequences with his teammates and fans) is lost in the bedroom.

The knowledge of the science is very good most of the time and some of the writing is sometimes so sophisticated it made me think that this was an experienced writer but then it would go downhill again.There are a number of typos, misspellings, and wrong use of words, for example: their instead of they're, conger (an eel) where the word should have been conjure. One of the major characters from the Mars site named Clapton just disappears about half way through the story after the capture by the aliens - no I don't mean the aliens killed him or something else dire happened to him - the author just forgot him. Also it would seem to me that a nuclear winter lasting 300 or more years would not have resulted in just a colder climate in Oregon but an all out ice age.I know writers (and obviously editors) tend to get lazy due to the use of spell checkers but for goodness sake, USE A GRAMMAR CHECKER as well.Like I said, I would have given 4 stars due to the plot, action, and the interesting take on time travel but . . .","12 10, 2011",A2W92T8XJFO3BN,"Mary D.

A world where angels and vampires not only co-exist, but have an interesting connection. As a Guild Hunter, one of those that hunts rogue vampires down for the angels, Ashwini finds herself suddenly stuck between two vampire factions, and the angel wanting to manipulate them all, in Atlanta. She turns, for help, to Janvier, a vampire himself - who may have his own reasons for assisting her.From the first moment I started this novella I was immediately immersed in the world. I couldn't have stopped reading if there was a fire. Okay. I hope I could have at least paused to get out of the building, but you get the picture.I'm continually amazed by Nalini's ability to create fully realized characters, especially in novellas where the shortened format makes that difficult for a lot of authors. Angels' Pawn is no different. Ashwini is a compelling character from her first moments pounding on a door. I'm completely intrigued by her, and really hope that we get to see more of her in the future.Janvier. Wow. What can I say except I want to meet him. A native from the bayous, with an old world charm, and an, apparently, innate sexiness, he is just fantastic. Watching him play off of Ashwini, lightening the mood and at the same time ratcheting up their relationship throughout everything they were trying to accomplish in Atlanta was truly a joy.I can not wait to read Angels' Blood which focuses on Elena and Raphael, I believe. But I'm really hoping to see more from Janvier and Ashwini in the future. Their storyline was by no means complete - although the main conflict is tied up in the novella - we have lots more to hear about this pair.Nalini's said it, but I'm going to give this warning to those that need an HEA. This is not a typical romance with a bow-tied HEA at the end.It's a fantastic read, a great introduction, and I highly recommend it. If you've not read anything by Nalini Singh, I urge you to run out and buy everything you can by her.

However, as a deaf woman talking to people around her,  communication becomes draining and leaves her needing solitude to recharge. Her brother Tad may have had to cancel on their ski trip at the last minute, but Robin decides to go by herself, looking forward to peace and quiet. When Robin is interrupted on her trip by the appealing Keil and his brother, she discovers life will never be the same again.Wolf Signs is a short, fast read that will appeal to paranormal romance and erotica lovers alike. Robin is stunned to find out that werewolves real, she never really knew the truth about her family, and that she has found her very own wolf mate in Keil. The attraction is immediate and hot enough to melt the mountain snow. Personally, I am not a big fan of erotica so I admit, I skipped the sex scenes, but the bits I saw are sure to satisfy readers who enjoy erotica.The plot was kept somewhat simplified to fit into the shorter word count, but Vivian Arend still managed to pack in a lot of action to keep the story moving. I loved how Robin was so happy to find out why she never quite felt like she fit anywhere, and adjusts quite easily to her new life.

It was slow paced and kind of boring at times, but it also managed to make me smile now and then.It was not an entirely boring or bad read, but nevertheless, it didn't really manage to capture my interest all that much. I didn't feel the urge to read the book in order to find out what happens next, what will happen to those two MCs. I just wasn't caught up in this book.Jae and Kelly were, on some level, interesting characters, well, interesting enough, at least. They're likable. I liked the fact that Kelly suffered from OCD, it was a good idea--attempt--, but it lacked believability at times. In my opinion, the research (by the author) on that topic fell a bit flat.And it's more or less the same with Jae's asthma: One time he's running like hell after Kelly and his ever-present sidekick Will which leads to ""the worst asthma attack Jae has had for a very long time"". So far, so good. Not quite realistic, however, is that Jae, while practically choking, can still have a conversation with Kelly at the same time. Well...There were some other things that weren't quite believable or that bothered me, but I won't list them all here.

I have always had an interest in cryptozoology, so naturally when I saw this book I knew I had to read it. After having done so, I honestly feel like this might have been a rejected manuscript from the Syfy Channel.The writing is just plain bad. The story reads like the manuscript to a B movie and the plot is predictable. The opening of the book describes the creature in too great of detail. From that point on what is going to happen is rather painfully obvious.

But, she has for some reason decided to go along with it, probably since she can't seem to say no to a friend in need, as long as she wears a mask.  She is surprised at how wicked it all makes her feel, and how she can let her lusty inner devil out.Detective Nick West is at the club, on his own time, trying to get Mistress Christmas to try and rob him, as his close friend claims happened to him.  He can't believe that the leggy brunette with the smoky eyes is the one responsible for the deeds his friend claims.  But she definitely gets his blood running at a fever pitch.Their attraction is mutual and when Holly blurts out her Christmas wish on the second night they meet he is only too happy to grant it.  The thing is one night might not be enough for either, can Holly reveal her real self to Nick? Will they both take a chance on love?But, with one misunderstanding it all might be lost.Mistress Christmas is a fantastic addition to the Wild West Boys.  This one from the West side of the family and in a big city no less.  I loved how Nick is thrown into falling for a woman he thinks there is no way he can have.  Another lesson in ""don't choose a book by its cover"".  Ms. James continues to keep me hooked on her books by writing fun and spunky characters.  I look forward to more of her stories both on and off the ranch. Mistress Christmas is a super fun holiday themed read that can be read at any time of the year.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","10 26, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1256515200
10559,B00318D9UG,"[0, 0]","The Chroniech are back and looking for a rematch. This is the third in the series and has the same light elements as the other two: superficial characters, rapidly acquired and applied technology usually attributed to one individual and a type of deus ex machina ending. The strengths are some of the descriptions of the nature and effect of the weapons like the Harrington series by Weber. But the battles are so large and the outcome (in most cases) pre determined, that it seems like an extraneous detail. The battle might involve hundreds if not thousands of ships and the details of some small number of ships in the group being destroyed by a specific weapon system is interesting but ultimately irrelevant. It is like reading how a few soldiers died in a company level conflict (but without the emotional impact)  Although the author does give some delay to putting new weapons systems into place in the middle of a war, when you take into account that this will span light years, different planets and cultures, the speed is still excessive. I found myself reading quickly through this to see how it would end rather than enjoying the details.","04 29, 2012",A1X2PFF07KP6IJ,Brian Asalone,1335657600
1153,B004D4YL3Q,"[1, 1]","I read this novella as part of the Bound Temptations anthology but this review just includes my thoughts on Beg Me:Now, I'll admit that if I'd realised the contents of this story before I picked the anthology up I probably wouldn't have read it so I'm not really the best person to judge this one. I'm not a fan of rape fantasies but I decided to give it a try because I like the author's writing style. I did like Tania at first, she had been through a horrible ordeal after the death of her husband and then being raped in her own home and I felt really bad for her. I can't even begin to imagine how messed up that would have left her and I admired her for wanting to take her life back and replace the bad memories with good ones. Drake was her husbands best friend and has been in love with Tania forever, he has always been there for her and was understandably the first one that she turned to.Now I consider myself quite an open minded person and although Tania's fantasy isn't my idea of fun I don't have a problem with it as long as the people involved are consenting adults. The bondage side to their relationship and the dirty talk was fine and was even quite hot in places but events towards the end left me cold. Where it went wrong for me was when Tania practically forced Drake to do something that he was obviously very uncomfortable with - she was trying to wipe away the memories of her own rape which I can understand to a degree but that doesn't give her the right to force the man she is supposed to be falling for into doing something that hurt him emotionally. I felt so bad for Drake, he loves Tania so much that he would do anything for her and I felt she took advantage of that and it really made me dislike her. That scene ruined the whole novella for me which was such a shame.","09 13, 2012",A2EU9VP0MRMUGE,Sarah (Feeling Fictional),1347494400

When I started reading this book, the 10-year old voodoo-relate CRIME of a child killing her mother drew me in, & I looked forward to reading what I thought would be a story in which the practice of voodoo would play a predominant role.  That , unfortunately, was not the case at all.  Having now read the whole book, I have to say that I am really not sure what the book was about - just a lot of senseless killings that had some tenuous link, at best, to the original 10-yr old murder that actually had nothing to do with voodoo.

As such, I have a particular bias against books and works of fiction that attack Christians and conservatives. The author basically boils down the cause of all ills leading to his fictional civil war as non-catholic Christian social conservatives. He presents the premise that because Christian evangelicals refused to sit down, shut up, and let the slaughter of innocence continue, it caused a civil war. Because this same group refused to condone gay marriage, it caused a civil war. Because conservatives refused to allow the Federal government to grow into the single authority in the country, it caused a civil war. He lays all the blame for societies ills at the feet of those who believe in living their lives according to God's word, who also believe that the constitution and the Bill of Rights should apply to the Federal Government. The narrator, due to his many years of reflection, comes to understand that the beliefs he once held, contributed to the war. A reformed Christian and Conservative...who better to tell the story, right?I will say that the story is well written, in that it flows well. How the narrator came to be telling his story is an interesting premise. Beyond that, it's really a waste of time. At least it's cheap entertainment.","06 21, 2010",A1MQF9RG9H13SJ,S. F.

I thought the cover looked nice. ..So I figured, what the heck, I'll give it a try.  Well, it was surprisingly nice.I guess I'm a sap, but unlike some reviewer's, I enjoyed the cliche a and hackneyed phrases.After finishing the book my first thought was, darn, I can't believe this is only a 200 page story.  It just seemed it should be longer, there was so much going on.  And that's a good thing!With all the action, it just felt like 5 books crammed into one, but that definitely made it more entertaining to read though.With that said, there were a couple of things that I wanted to point out that made this story special for me that were not covered in any of the previous reviews. Despite all the violence and sex, (not complaining, those Were's deserved to die!  LOL ) that is typical for shifter stories, the overall theme was about family.Sasha was an abused, isolated omega, without any family, that's the beginning of the story.Then he meets his mate/spouse (beginnings of family).I've read enough shifter stories to make the whole psychology of how and why mates are attracted, superfluous, so I'm cool with the intro.Then he gets a pack, his old pack back actually (extended family).  That includes of course, Vadim's parents (in-laws).  Then there were two more facets of family that fell into place.  I won't include those as that would be too much of a ""spoiler.""  Let's just say, that if you liked theThe Lamb Who Cried Wolf [Mate or Meal 1] (Siren Publishing Classic ManLove), then you should enjoy this story too.Last but not least, another aspect I really appreciated about this author's writing was the humor.  I can never get enough of laughing.  What can I say?  I'd like to finish up with one of the many parts of the story that I found humorous.  It shouldn't be a spoiler, don't worry!  :)Oh, to understand this part, you have to understand that Vladim and Sasha are going through those uncontrollable mating urges that all newly formed bonded mates go through in shifter stories.  Hehe.Oh, and Vadim has captured Shasha in a wrestling match (sort of) and pinned him to the ground, while they are supposed to be on the way to a meeting with the beta's and in-laws. (hint...this happens to Sasha a lot! )  ;)""Vadim growled as Sasha wiggled the apex of his thighs against Vadim's growing co**.  Sasha scooted back a little as he sat up, his hands resting on Vadim's chest.Vadim gripped Sasha's hip to hold him in place over his co** when he spotted a flash of fabric beyond Sasha's shoulder.

The emotional connection really seemed to be lacking and I couldn't grasp how fast the female characters fell in love with their captors.  The stories seem to be running back to back in a timeline but the human females never interact even though their Cyborg captors do, albeit it sparingly.  I also didn't like how the characters from previous stories acquired their female slaves, fell in love with them, but had no problem giving another human female to their Cyborg friends as gifts.  It's as if the author is saying that even though the characters fall in love with humans the Cyborgs still consider humans to be no better than property.I think the concept of this story was too much for my preconceived notions to overcome.  When you say, &#34;Cyborg&#34;, I think Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator.  The whole human slave issue was also hard to come to terms with, as was the fact that the male character was gray.

It was a total waste of my good time, which happens to be as valuable as anyone else. Jackie either give away a book or sell them as a whole novel, with a beginning and end.

To do this, they need the assistance of some humans in the entertainment industry.  They decide to go with Calypso Productions, but the meeting is a disaster.  In the end, Luke asks one of the women to meet again somewhere else, hoping he can convince her to help in a less formal setting.  The woman, Lena, asks him to dinner.  Though he's nervous--and attracted to Lena--Luke agrees.Lena has risen to a position of influence as a founding member of Calypso Productions.  Together with her three friends, she's one of Hollywood's young elite.  Normally she would blow off a guy who gives a presentation as awkwardly as Luke and his friends did.  Since she finds him attractive, however, she asks him to dinner with the intention of seducing him.  Will Lena still want Luke when she discovers what he and his friends are?Lights, Camera...Monsters is a cute and interesting tale of what happens when an up-and-coming Hollywood businesswoman meets a monster, literally.  Lena is secure in her own place in the world, and proud of her accomplishments.  She's tough and knows what she wants.  Luke, with his mixture of toughness and tenderness, confidence and vulnerability, throws her for a loop.  The scene in which she first sees Luke's true form is really funny.  I liked Luke's navet&eacute; regarding human customs, and his uncertainty.  He softened some of Lena's grating edges.  The storyline itself is engaging, with lots of sex, some action and suspense, and a rather unusual take on the paranormal/monster genre.  Secondary characters, including Luke's friends and Lena's business partners, are clearly destined for their own stories.  If you like the paranormal but are getting tired of the same old creatures, Lights, Camera...Monsters is a good choice.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","02 9, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1234137600

For once it's Jacob who's having difficulties in his case and Victor (with a distressed Lisa) come to the rescue. In the previous books Jacob was the one in control, but in this book the single-mindedness with which he pursues both the resolution of his case and Victor borders on possession. Victor for once seems to be able to assert himself, even the way he embraces his jealousy was a surprise for me.

We get slavers and a man who would be king. We get an ingenious solution to the question of how shoot down a helicopter above you when everything you have points downwards. And there is a great hand-to-hand battle for the culmination.The only negatives I had were that the peacekeepers start to act even more like vigilantes in this novel, and it brings up the question of when is it appropriate to be judge, jury and executioner?  The novel does address this, but it could have gone into more depth on the subject. Also, the battles seem a bit too easy for the peacekeepers and over too quickly for me. I would have liked the major battles to not have ended so quickly. The action was very good, which is probably why I wanted it to go on longer!I would rate this book somewhere between a 3 and a 4, and I gave it a 4 rating for the fact that it IS better than the first two books and does a very good job of expanding the peacekeeper universe and not just rehashing previous novels.

185,B001BRD238,"[1, 1]","Psycops is one of my favorite urban fantasies and Secrets is my favorite in the series thus far. Jordan Castillo Price has created a fun world, with interesting mysteries and with funny (yes, here is that word again) and sexy characters. Despite being urban fantasy, the characters and the setting are written in very a realistic manner and despite having a romance storyline throughout the books and the series, the romance does not overwhelm the storyline.The setting is Chicago and unlike another of my favorite urban fantasy authors that sets his books in Chicago, Jordan Castillo Price gets Chicago right. Throughout the Psycops series there are 4 key characters. Vic is the main character who is police officer. He is extremely insecure, socially awkward, completely jealous of his boyfriend's former lover yet still very endearing. Vic has an absent partner, Lisa - a very funny and loving person. Then we have Jacob, Vic's serious boyfriend and Jacob's partner Carolyn. Now comes the urban fantasy part of the series - Vic, Lisa and Carolyn each possess different psychic skills and as a result, are employed by police departments to assist in solving crimes. Jacob is not psychically talented but he is very much interested in people who are. Much of the series centers on Vic dealing with his ""talent"", which is seeing and communicating with ghosts, using his talent to solve a crime and the interplay of Vic's relationship with Jacob.The strength of the series to me is the incredibly complex characters Ms. Price writes, along with witty humor. When I am reading any one book in this series I am literally laughing out loud and marking excerpt after excerpt. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves urban fantasy, mysteries or just self-effacing humor. Below are some excerpts from Secrets I particularly liked:(Vic commenting on the new home that he and his boyfriend moved in to and of which he spent the recent few days attempting to organize - unsuccessfully): ""When I got home from work, the cannery looked like an actual dwelling instead of a warehouse that'd been organized by a nearsighted drunk.""""A flicker of actual interest registered in the receptionist's eyes.  `Third floor, Detective.'  And if she noticed that Lisa was dressed in a mishmash of men's sweats, she didn't so much as blink over it.""""the longer I sat there, the closer I was to trying another sip of that decaf coffee.  I stood up and wondered if I was supposed to walk around and pull Lisa's chair out for her, but she was on her feet and bussing her own tray before I even had my own chair pushed in.""""I looked at Jacob.  He was watching me.  Still smiling.  I did my best to telepathically scream, `What the hell?' I don't think he received it.""""How could he do this to us? To me.  To either of us.  We were all in on it, all four of us.  Lisa might survive women's prison if she joined a Mexican gang.  Carolyn wou8ld probably be a smear on the wall within the first week.  I could squeak by if I was still good at being invisible.  But Jacob would be a big trophy kill, shanked by some tough guy looking to prove himself, probably beaten and tortured first.

Well, when that doesn't work, she goes off to her seat and is lured in by Klaus. Now, Twyla suspects Nikos is a vampire, and possibly Klaus, but has no solid proof. That is until Klaus puts the moves on her and almost inducts her into the ""Mile High Club"". Nikos is all over the both of them swearing to protect her and wrangling her away from Klaus. A trip in the Limo confirms her suspicions and has her begging for Nikos' bite. Boy is there a lot going on in Limo's in both Meier's Corners and New York City!

6754,B0014YB7LM,"[11, 15]","When deciding whether or not to give this novel a try, keep the old saying in mind: ""Never judge a book by its cover."" The dainty-looking lass gracing ""The May Carousel's"" cover is Kay McCann--a promising California artist and teacher whose personality and life are anything but picture-perfect. Brandishing only a blue streak, she rescues her seemingly soft-spoken English art model, Jason Allen, from a carjacking.  Jason, like Kay, is also not what he seems because once he accepts Kay's offer to mend his wounds, his secret plan for her is hatched.  And once Kay lets Jason through her apartment door, the plan is well on its way; and soon, so are they--from L.A. to London in a tantilizing search for the man who painted Kay's portrait, Peter Lawson: an internationally-renown ""artist"" thought to be dead...until now.""The May Carousel"" adds warmth, maturity, and a degree of realism to the spy genre. It's largely British in tone but more reminiscent of a John Buchan or Alfred Hitchcock romantic mystery than an Ian Fleming or John le Carre Cold War saga. Much like the artwork that populates the novel, author Leslie Wooddavis's characters are well-drawn. Some gravitate more toward the greater good that espionage purports to protect. But for the most part, their lives are more colorful than those living in  le Carre's gray surroundings; and their personalities, deeper than the martini-sipping swagger of the typical 007 stick figure.Kay McCann is a refreshingly humorous and self-reliant woman who is slowly drawn into suave art dealer Jason Allen's snare. But if you think Jason is the villain, again, ""Never judge a book..."" It's another high mark for Wooddavis's style: It's clever in how well it constructs its characters. Genuine love, trust, and friendship begin to sway Jason's thoughts. And Kay recovers the love, trust, and friendship that she thought was lost--felt only in fleeting flashbacks. It all makes for a potent story that builds to a truly stunning--though regrettably sensible--conclusion that will catch most readers by surprise.If the story itself is compelling, the pace lags in places--particularly in the middle. The beginning has a strong hook, with the introduction of Jake Thorton (Jason's smarmy American associate who is as adept at the art of deception as he is art dealing). Jason's wooing of Kay is a bit too involved at the start, but does the trick. But once the proceedings reach London, the novel spends too much time sorting through a love triangle. Though a few car chases and Kay's melees with would-be kidnappers help put things back in perspective, the excessive emphasis placed on romantic complexities almost undermines the greater idea: That art and romance are tactics in a bigger game being played.Still, Leslie Wooddavis triumphs in delivering a first-rate read--effective storytelling highlighted by a memorable cast of characters brought to life by a plot and dialog that  switch from sentimental to self-controlled on a dime. But best of all, ""The May Carousel"" is unique in its ability to add human warmth to the spy story scene--a genre that is typically a cold-blooded battle royal of barbs, bullets, and bombs.","12 15, 2011",AV64Y0L3C45UX,James Blakley,1323907200

173,B003N3V61S,"[6, 9]","There's certain (sub-)genres I go into with high expectations. I have questions and I want answers. I want a specific thing told to me about what the genre is, it has to be believable, I want to be convinced on certain things but above that I want to be made to understand and believe them. Unfortunately, m&eacute;nages are at the top of that list. I need the story sold to me, to have it believable but it has to suck me in right from the beginning or there's no hope of redemption. That's a bit harsh, I know, and I'm sorry, but it's the way I feel with m&eacute;nages.With that said, this book frustrated me beyond belief. It didn't start off on a good note for me. The first 50% of the book is essentially just smut and for someone like me who prefers at least double the plot than smut, it was unbearable to get through. I was extremely close to calling this my first DNF but I agreed to stick it out until the half-way mark... Thankfully, the book finally caught my eye around that time (although it could have also been from the fact I cheated and skipped to certain parts of the book to see if I was actually wasting my time or not).Now, just to clarify, I'd say this book is made up of about 60-70% smut. Which I hated and resulted in me skipping those scenes. They were redundant, boring and unnecessary. Only a select few actually contributed to the story. The rest of it seemed like a page filler to me.It was hard for me to connect with the three MCs. For one, Luke, which is the only pov we get (in first person) is never actually described. So, I have no idea what he looks like and if he was described then I completely missed that because I don't remember any description about him regarding his appearances besides a reference to his father. Richard and Matthew, the other MCs, are perfectly described. But the thing is none of them know anything about each other. Like nothing. At ALL. They jumped into bed together at a club. Three times. Agree to go on a date. Still know nothing about each other. Then move in together. Still not knowing anything about each other. I didn't like it. Especially with the fact Luke didn't want to put Matthew or Richard into a situation of possibly getting hurt by his father but he still moved in with them when he knew his father would eventually find him and seek to make their lives a living hell. Yeah.....Anyway, so, yeah. I was frustrated throughout most of the book. To me, the relationship wasn't believable. I still don't understand their relationship. Yeah, at the end, you can tell they loved each other but it was made impossible for me to love them because there was no dialogue between them getting to know each other. What we know of them is what Luke gave us in brief summaries of what he learned from their 'dates'. Well, I wanted to actually experience those dates. Instead, I got the smexing after the date.Needless to say, I didn't much like this book. I couldn't connect with the characters or their relationship, the smexing put me off so much from the start there was barely a chance of redemption for this story. With that said, I did appreciate Sloan Parker's writing. It drew me in when the smut didn't overpower the pages. That's what captured my attention and made me want to keep reading when all I wanted to do was complain about the book. I was ready to give up on it but then the smexing lessened slightly and her words drew me in.

Oh Mommy, he could get the firstborn kid. *smirk* I am suitably crazy over Lynn Lorenz's stories so I knew in advance that I would love this one. The fact that it describes my idea of the perfect vacation didn't hurt, either.Troy is doing the typical &#34;I can make him love me if we just spend enough time together&#34; single guy dance. In my book, if you have to &#34;make&#34; someone love you then it isn't real. He's been lusting after this idiot, Douglas, for a year. Troy has gone to great lengths to try to make himself attractive to this jerk, even though Troy's best friend describes Troy as smart, witty, and a gorgeous guy with a heart of gold. But, now Troy has his chance. He's spending a week on a cruise with Douglas and other friends and Troy just knows that when the seven days are up, Douglas will be his. When Troy's apartment goes up in flames due to his neighbor smoking while sleeping, Troy is forced out the bathroom window to balance precariously three stories up on a tiny ledge. Yikes!Lucky for Troy, Jason is the gorgeous firefighter who saves him and brings him down on the ladder. Troy realizes at the hospital that he has no one to call to come pick him up. He has no cell phone, no wallet, no money, no home. Troy is shocked when Jason appears at the hospital to check on him and even more surprised when Jason offers to let Troy stay with him until he can get things sorted out. Jason is a little surprised that he made the offer, too, but something about Troy rouses protective and possessive feelings that Jason has never had. It doesn't take these two gorgeous men long before they've fallen into bed and Jason is introducing Troy to a little bondage play. These guys are very intense and the sex is incredible. Jason is determined to give Troy a vacation he won't ever forget, and in the process hopes that Troy won't want to leave when his friends come back.The vacation starts with Jason getting Troy into much better-looking clothes than Dockers and button-downs. Troy is only five years older so why dress like an old man? Next it's up to the lake for a day of Jet Skis and parasailing, stuff Troy's never done before, and they have a blast. Jason takes Troy deep-sea fishing and it's some of the most fun Troy has ever had. Jason doesn't want to bring up looking for a new apartment and Troy doesn't either, but both believe the other wants them to, and so begin the miscommunications. Neither one of them wants to speak up about their feelings for fear if being hurt. Silly men. HA!If you enjoy a lighthearted romance with not a lot of drama but an incredible amount of sex, then this might be the story for you. It's fun, sweet, and sexy with a good ending.

1213,B002E19KU4,"[1, 1]","I can understand why more readers haven't discovered H.P. Lovecraft. Many of today's readers prefer the sudden shock of horror featured in modern horror stories and films to Lovecraft's slowly building sense of unease. Lovecraft is the foul breath across the back of the neck or the cold hand that brushes your's in the dark. In other words, it takes a bit of work to appreciate Lovecraft's stories. Written mostly in the 1920s and '30s, Lovecraft may seem a bit outdated, but getting to know his tales is worth the effort.In this volume are 67 of Lovecraft's stories. I would argue that this collection is not necessarily ""definitive,"" but at least it provides a good overview of his work. Here are many stories in his Cthulhu mythos. For the uninitiated, these are stories of ancient gods who are at best indifferent to mankind's existence (and at worst outright hostile). There are also stories that stand alone and are creepy in their own right without the presence of ancient god-like beings. Many of his stories were originally published in the early pulp magazines, but don't let that questionable pedigree scare you away.Among my favorites are At the Mountain of Madness, The Colour Out of Space, Cool Air and ... well, just read them for yourself and pick your own favorites. A couple of minor caveats, however. First, Lovecraft depends more on mood and creepiness to tell his stories. For readers accustomed to horror that is both quick and gross, Lovecraft may seem curiously old-fashioned. Two, Lovecraft was a product of his times. As such, some of his depictions may come across as racist. Beyond that, enjoy these stories - whether you are reading them for the first time or coming back to them after years away. This collection marks an excellent point at which to start.","10 31, 2011",A38Q3T99Z5X2LX,W. V. Buckley,1320019200

663,B001V9KG4E,"[3, 3]","I have mixed feelings about this book. I feel that the idea of the book was a good one (what would survival after a catastrophic event look like).However I felt the characters were not appropriate for the adversity and the challenging experiences that the author wanted to explore.Let me say that I felt there was a fair amount of thought put into the steps needed to have the characters survive. This was a strong plus towards making the in the book creditable, if not for the characters ages.I liked that the book took place over two and a half year time frame, giving opportunities for us (the reader) to see how the characters lives might unfold and what other issues would come up.What I did not like about the book can be narrowed down to two things.One (and this was the biggest) was that the age of the characters was simply too young to cover the issues that the author was trying to tackle, making it all seem less believable.For example our main character 'Chief' Mike. At age 13 and a half, he takes on the role of leader for the surviving teenagers. The concerns and decisions that he comes up with are far greater then what a 13 year old would come up with. Even given that he might be more 'mature' emotionally then others his age, however there is no explanation as to 'Why' he would be more mature in his understanding of life and leadership. Without this explanation, his 'judgements' and 'rules' do not sit right with reality. I am left to say, ""That's pretty wise for an early teenager, and where is his teen emotions?""I could do this same break down with the remaining characters, but you can get the idea with this one and I shouldn't go on and on about that.The next issue that I have with the book is that often the mini-crises in the story do not flow with the over all story. They seem to be cut and pasted into the storyline. It would have been more realistic to have less events play out then to have the extra mini-crises.For example the whole lodge situation, it was announced, then left until the last part of the book to be hastily played out. I felt it was poorly played out leaving me feeling flat about its resolution.So what do I think of the story and do I recommend it?I think it is worth the read, but one should have low expectations, just as you would for a 'made for T.V.' movie as opposed to a 'made for the theater' movie. If you lower your expectations you probably will enjoy this book. Because I actually did enjoy it once I finally decided just to let the 'issues' be and imagine the characters say five years older (each).Due to some of the content (rape, murder and violence) within the book, I would recommend it to readers above the age of 16.I would like to see other works by this author, as I enjoyed the storyline, and feel that maybe in time the author will improve his craft.","04 13, 2012",A1U3LIALASYOLZ,T.

Unfortunately there were too many characters telling the story.  Each had redeeming qualities that could have been developed making the reader care about the character's fate. Yet it would have taken too many pages to keep it light. I believe a few story lines should have been left out and more time spent digging into the personalities of a select few.  In my opinion there were many odds and ends which didn't need to be told and many that did and weren't.This book has great potential and if rewritten could be quite successful. I liked this writer well enough I will check back in a few years to see if she has developed her style into something wonderful.  Offering it for free was a good idea and I hope the reviews help her work on becoming a better story teller.

There were also many times in which names were misspelled: 'Carter' becomes 'Carted', and so on. This book needs the loving care of a good editor!Despite the amateur errors, I was able to finish reading the book. It turns out to be a roller-coaster of events which take place during the course of a high school boy and girl breaking up and getting back together again. Along the way, we experience all sorts of random things from toothbrush abortions to Listerine-chugging pregnant preteens. It's all a bit over the top, but perhaps being shocking is the name of the game here? I would suppose many vanilla people might be shocked at this book. It seems to poke at just about every taboo and deviancy that it can, while drenching every sentence with sex. That is not to say that it hits on all of them - the author doesn't seem to have as much experience as they try to push into their book. Again, the more vanilla readers might get a bit put off by this book, but it's really not that far into the dark side.My gut wants to say that this is a book written for teenagers, but with the level of storytelling regarding adult topics, I'm not sure that would be a wise target audience. Unfortunately, older people are just a bit too mature to relate to the story.

I found it detracted from the story and made me not like Prophecy's character at times. If you truly have met your soul mate and are in love with them, then I don't see how all that other nonsense could be going on, it was just aggravating and I ended up wanting Valentine to rip Venturi's head off and knock Prophecy upside her head. I was glad that it ended in a way that let me feel that she and Venturi would just be friends and her relationship with Valentine would be solid. Then I made the mistake of reading the preview for Spellbound at the end. What!? No way Valentine is okay with that nonsense, just because he accepted that she felt some love for Venturi, and that was even stretching it for me, doesn't mean he'd be okay with that! I guess I loved the first book and then it all slowly went downhill for me because of this. I wish it could have been a stronger relationship between Valentine and Prophecy, because no matter how often prophecy says it's not even a fraction to what I feel for you to Valentine it's still inappropriate to my mind.

Yet there is a nice little plot interweaved  that is thoroughly enjoyable and allows you to convince yourself you're not just reading smut. *grin* Good characters, nice story, happy ending.Aside:The Badlands books are written by ""Elle Saint James"" but looking around it appears this is a pseudonym. Does this matter? Probably not. And I'm not going to say who I believe it is, 'cause that would be telling... Okay, it's not difficult to work out but where would the fun be in that? If an author writes under multiple names, there's usually a reason. Often the author is testing a different voice, or a different genre. In this case I suspect she is using it to delve into the cowboy menage genre (not really featured under her other name). And ""Elle Saint James"" is an excellent name for Wild West author.

4622,B0046ZS296,"[6, 7]","The story is set in England, along the Dorset coast.  Our main character, Martin, is out in a boat one day and encounters a pair of dolphins (who knew there were dolphins in England??).  Some days later when a storm blows up unexpectedly, the dolphins come to Martin's aid when his boat engine fails.It turns out, the dolphins are a rare strain of shifters, who are born dolphin but can assume the form of a human.  The pair - George and Patrick - have come to like and trust Martin and they eventually share their secret with him.  For the dolphins, some abilities carry through each form, such as echolocation, and various quirky mating habits.  The latter comes up when the pair proposition Martin and he isn't shy about taking them up on the offer.  This isn't strictly m&eacute;nage sex; for the trio, it's generally two of the guys, then two others in succession.  And after the first day, the sex very much moves into the background of the story.Because then, the story turns to Martin's interest in an abandoned house along the coastline, and we follow along - in detail - as he talks with the owner, and arranges to lease and fix up the place.  We spend WAAAAAY too much time pursuing cellar passageways, and cleaning windows, and checking wiring.  Chapters are spent describing arranging for a surveyor to come out, and inspection of the septic tank, and buying appliances.  This degenerated into a DIY project that went on forEVER.  This was a long book - more than 4000 location - but the middle 2000 was about fixing up this house.And then, there's the bestiality subplot that brings sex back in towards the end of the story.  See, the dolphin guys would be keen to have sex with Martin while they are in dolphin form, even though that would require Martin being underwater during the whole thing, and potentially harmful penetration by a dolphin-sized penis.  Martin is VERY not comfortable with the idea, and it takes quite awhile to work up to things.  Even the dolphins are concerned about harming Martin - it's mentioned that the activity could even prove fatal if things went badly - but that doesn't dissuade anyone.  When they eventually Do the Deed, it is REALLY not sexy or erotic and I spent most of the time trying to avert my eyes, simply because of how the whole thing was written.Ultimately, this is a very ""English"" book.  Rather straight-laced English characters, English dialogue, very conservatively-paced proper storytelling.  In a word, it was boring.  Not bad, just too much time spent on stilted conversations and detailed home repair.  In the end, Martin and George and Patrick have rather decided to pursue a relationship of three, though it's never much discussed, and there are no declarations of strong feelings - let alone love!  The story kind of pans away at the end and a lot of things are just left unresolved.

Mentions of family ground both main characters but really it's a simple story of the beginning of their relationship. By the end, I wish I could've known more but as it is, I enjoyed Angie and Ryan's story.Already resigned to spending Christmas alone, Angie cannot believe it when she finds herself in the arms of her new boss at the office party. Their attraction is hot and his promises of things to come set her on fire. And then when she finds herself with not just one, but two gorgeous men - a powerful executive and one sexy cowboy - her holiday wishes are fulfilled.Ryan has never considered not sharing his women with his best friend Wade so it was only natural to introduce him to Angie. But when she stirs feelings inside him, Ryan realizes that one decadent night of m&eacute;nage was enough and now he wants her all to himself. Finding that time and understanding that they were on the same wavelength only reinforces his feelings.To Ryan's surprise, what starts out as hot sex turns into something deeper. I just wish the story of Angie and Ryan could've happened without the m&eacute;nage with Wade. It just didn't seem necessary and it felt like a dark spot on their beginning.

It's hard to explain what I hated about this book without specific references to what DIDN'T happen. No plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Disappointing book 2 of the Halle Pumas paranormal romance series that starts withThe Wallflower: A Hunting Love story, Halle Puma Series Book 1.. You HAVE to read book 1 first as this one starts during the climax of that book. While I am a fan of Ms. Bell's work, I have to tell you I am REALLY disappointed with this book. Book 1 was overly simplistic, but I could forgive that because it was book 1- this book was a step backwards entirely. I'm not even sure why this story got to be its own book. It could have been just an additional chapter or two in book 1.CHARACTERS: It is possible for characters to be UN-DEVELOPED? Simon and Becky are both great characters- but they were developed more in Book 1 than in this book ABOUT THEM. In fact, many of their mannerisms from book 1 disappeared and they became just cardboard cut-outs of what any couple in any shifter romance story could be. The tension between them evaporated- they were dancing around each other before, afraid and uncertain. Simon was artistic and a ladies' man and Becky was the shy, well-grounded partner in her store, but none of those characteristics were apparent in this story. They actually LOST their personality.PLOT: There was even LESS plot here than the product description implies. This was basically a continuation of book 1. There was no additional storyline. No additional conflict. No new bad guys. No new obstacles. It looked like Becky might have a long road to recovery after the attack- she needed to heal and to come to terms with what happened and finding out about the pumas... and that was all resolved in a couple paragraphs. Becky wasn't mad. She wasn't scared. She wasn't even badly injured. She didn't resist Simon. She didn't play hard to get. Simon didn't have to woo her or apologize. Simon supposedly had been a ladies' man- but even THAT didn't become an issue. No confrontation with Belinda or other exes. No discussion around why they never dated or expressed interest in each other sooner... NOTHING!!! More happened between these two in book 1 than here. It takes exactly one minute for Becky to just accept the existence of werecats, the fact that she's Simon's mate, and the fact that she has been turned into one.Like Max with Emma, Simon changed Becky into a puma without warning and without asking permission. She didn't complain- not ONE word of protest. She wasn't concerned about what it might mean for her life. She wasn't even surprised. Seriously, that's just absurd. If for no other reason than it could have offered something more substantial for the story!!!There was a very bizarre plot element of having Becky able to tell when the phone was going to ring before it did. What on earth was that about? It was cute, but didn't come to anything.BOTTOM LINE: This book was infuriatingly dull. I would tell you not to bother reading it, except I expect you probably need to if you want to bother with the rest of the series. I'm not really sure I do at this point. Ms. Bell's The Grey Court series is MUCH better than this one- at least it has a plot.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series2.

6823,B001892DGG,"[0, 0]","Originally posted at: [...]If you enjoy paranormal romances with funny quips, sassy mates and well developed characters then The Wallflower will be a treat.Emma is a hot ticket. Maybe she used to be a wallflower in high school but those days are long behind her. Well, they should be but there's this one babe who is a thorn in her side. I found Emma's response to the witch as one I could respect and very classy. She now gives as good as she gets and I enjoyed every minute of it. Some people are inherently nasty and never seem to grow up, so the secondary character that plagues Emma is a great personality to showcase the inner strength that Emma now has.And the part where she was snarling at Max, the way that whole scene was written had me grinning ear to ear. I could visualize it in my head and I would adore seeing that on the big screen. Even at her most grouchy, it was still romantic.Max is the alpha and a very interesting man. Ms. Bell's choice of scene for Max's introduction to Emma was classic and quite fun. It had a real presence to it, a fullness that resonated with me and hooked me.He's a classic kind of character, full of take charge genes that demand capitulation from those he is in charge of. When Emma stands up to him, the resulting reaction is everything I could wish in a man who becomes besotted with his future mate, and the hunt is on. What fun. I loved Max's strength, and so did Emma.One of the main things that hooked me about this story was the dialogue. When Emma called Max `Captain Caveman', it gave me the giggles. She has all these cute references to kitty litter and jokes about shifters in general that it gave me a good feeling about Emma's persona. She's a character that I'd like to know for real. Max's reaction to some of what she says is equally fun and enjoyable to read. He takes his role as alpha seriously but he knows how to have a good time as well, and his sense of humor compliments Emma. Ms. Bell must have a delightful sense of humor of her own, because this story is warm and loving even when the tension is high.The sensual and sexual tension is wonderfully built up and delivered. I have said it before in my reviews of paranormal romances and I'll say it again - I adore a good bite scene and this tale delivered splendidly. It was erotic, titillating and very satisfying. Another thing I appreciated was Ms. Bell's handling of Emma's reaction to the big revelation. This story was so well balanced, it made me feel good during and after my reading of it.The secondary characters each play a vital role in helping a reader understand the main personalities in the tale, or they contributed to the plot movement. Everyone was there for a reason and it was believable. The story is told in both Max's and Emma's points of view with a perfect balance to keep me interested and involved. The conflict is mostly external but it tweaked a few internal issues as well. I think this book was written with a fine balance between an involved and fleshed out storyline and the amount of sexual escapades between the hero and heroine. It satisfied my mind and my libido.The Wallflower is a book not to miss for readers who are looking for a hero and heroine who can make them smile, sigh and outright laugh. It's a vibrant and rich world of likeable characters and an interesting courtship between a hunky eye doctor and an adorably sassy shop owner. I had so much fun reading this book that I simply have to find more by Ms. Bell. Her writing is becoming an addiction I can't wait to indulge more in. I absolutely recommend reading this impish and delightfully saucy book.","09 10, 2010",A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...",1284076800

I've heard many good things about the book and was looking forward to a good read when it finally reached the top of my list of books to read. Although it was an interesting premise and the writing was all right, I just couldn't stay with it for very long at a time. It lacked that spark that makes for a really good book. It seemed at times as though it was about to catch fire but would fizzle out again before the flame got going good. The best way I can describe how I feel about this book is that it was a 'dry' read for me. I'm glad I read it though.

What Ren did was stupid, but he did have some justification.  He misunderstood Cade's actions.  I was confused by Cade's actions.  Then Cade held his grudge for an excessively long time.  But there is a happy ending.A secondary story involved someone vandalizing property.  That person's motives, methods, and actions were not shown.

She has a thing for her brother he had told her two years ago all the sexual things he would like to do to her . She had not seen him since. She had read books when she was in college that her mother called her a pervert so this is the reason of the story. She hears from Cole asking her about the party while she is pleasuring her self.  she has not  heard from him in two years.She goes to her father's he and Missy are not there.They are supposed to come back the next day except Cole comes. You find out her father has gotten Cole to teach her how to be submissive .She wakes up the next day tied down and spread eagle. He tells her she can say no but he never stops if she asks. He brings in another man who works for her father as well as Cole.For a threesome.So far no love or foreplay its what Cole wants.

However, more plot would have been nice and follow up at the HEA.Spolier!!!!!!!My main issue with the book is the fact that there were horrible rapes in the book. A barmaid who also sold sex (not the herione) was raped twice. She was gang raped the second time. There was no pleasure (no forced seduction here--which I don't like but I know some people do) however, the rape was descibed erotically. And it was not. Also, even after the herione witnessed the rapes of this woman and the woman was telling the truth about something she was doing, the heroine called her a whore.

Such a shame since I love Fairy Tales.I did like the idea behind the book. Old fairy tales and change it with a dark twist? To finally get to know the ""real person"" behind the story! I love it! And they are the ones who must protect us against evil? Marvelous ^^ Although I've never heard of Rip van Winkle, is it an American fairy tale?Not a lot happened in the story, some demons were killed, some ""action"" and that's it. Also not a lot of time passes in the story, two days at the most. I know there books and movies made about less time than that, but in this book there wasn't much content. Even the ending was over before I could blink with my eyes, I didn't even got the feeling that this would be the end! Beside that, too much of the story was focused on Greta's history. Although it's interesting to get to know the real Greta of Hansel and Gretel, I was more interested in the here and now, not what happened in the past.I also would have liked to see Rip and Greta struggle a bit more before they would be reunited as a couple. They only have one conversation and their back together after years of separation... Usually, it's not that easy isn't it? And personally I like a bit of tension and glances at each other before they succumbOverall rating 3 stars. Nice book for a rainy Sunday afternoon, when you've got nothing else to do.

3777,B002R5B0WI,"[2, 2]","The beginning of this book reminded me of the movie Kiss of the Dragon (with Jet Li and Bridget Fonda).  Though it started out as a familiar story, I have to say that it drew me in.  I liked Two right off the bat and hated Darren immediately.  This is big for me.  I have to have a develop ""relationship"" with the characters right away and Buecheler did that well in this book.After the first two chapters or so, I was just waiting for something to happen.  There was a lot of character and relationship development in the first half of the book (which is great) but not much else going on.  Once Theroen entered the picture the action seemed to stop.  Sure, there was Two's transition into a vampire and the feeding that comes along with it, but I feel like there could have been more action to draw the reader further into the story.  With character and relationship development and nothing else, it was hard to see what the whole plot of the story was aside from ""handsome vampire rescues girl"".The second half (well, really about 2/3 into it) finally got into the ""guts"" of the story, the plot development, the action and (let's face it) the whole point of the book.  With so much leading up to it, I was ready for some serious conflict, a really great fight scene or something along those lines.  I feel like that never happened.  Don't get me wrong, there were some great parts and some good ideas but I feel like the story fell flat.  There was so much potential for it to be really great but it never quite made it.  The best part was when Two returned to seek revenge (I'm not going to call that a spoiler because as soon as you start the book you know that's coming at some point in the book), but even that could have been better.  I just feel like it left something to be desired.Favorite quote:""Sex is sex.  Love is love.  The first is a raw biological process, the latter is something more.""It wasn't a bad book by any means.  It was a dark, gritty and dramatic story.  Once I finished, my first thought was that it was 4 star worthy.  But then I started writing my review and as I was rehashing the book in my head I started realizing that I wished there was more to the story.  There were some really great ideas (the progression into vampirism, the evil elder, the different effects that vampirism has on different people, etc.) but I just think they were poorly executed.  It had the potential to be a 5 star book with a little more action and if there was a little more effort and detail put into the key scenes.  I felt like by the time the story was fully developed the author rushed to finish the book.This is the first book in a trilogy.  I did like it and I will be downloading the next book, Blood Hunt, when it's released.","02 28, 2011",A292CCQABG9ZVM,"Kelly S. ""Book Lover""",1298851200

8329,B003IHW2EY,"[2, 3]","It's been six months but I remember buying this book because I'd seen a semi-positive review on a blog--Dear Author probably--and because a romance of a mixed-race couple in the 1860's Wild West sounded intriguing. Especially since neither character is white.Unfortunately the story didn't live up to its promise.I did like the start of the book, although I did think it somewhat boring. The author spends a lot of time setting the scene and describing the life of a Chinese worker building the railroads for a pittance and the life of a black single woman trying to build a new life and a business for herself and her friend. Bias, racism, sexism, it's all there and prevalent in the vernacular.As if that's not enough to create obstacles to the couple's happiness, there's also their inability to fully understand each other. Quiang speaks but a little English and he and Leah have to communicate through gestures, looks, and touches.There's all this, and what does the author do with it? Nothing. Cullars glosses over all the difficult--and rewarding--steps of a meaningful relationship building and focuses on the paper thin physical attraction instead. There's a brief mention of how Leah and Quiang learn to communicate with the help of a dictionary, but they don't really talk to each other. When they're together they're either taking their clothes of and having sex or putting their clothes on and thinking about having sex. And those sex scenes are bad. There's creaming and there's tumescence, there's orbs and there's the infamous ""her sex"" euphemism.After all that, the story and my rating for it could have been saved had I bought Quiang's interactions with the triad members. I can't really pinpoint my problem with them, but something in the language used left me unconvinced. It wasn't just Wao's refusal to call an erection an erection, it was also how the revelation of the misappropriation was handled. Until then, I had liked Quiang's willingness to engage in shady businesses for quick profit and that both characters had such defined lives outside each other, after it just felt anticlimactic.I didn't want a happily ever after epilogue, I wanted to read how they get there.So what does the book have? Good historical description with nascent characterisations, but without any real character or relationship development, and a whiff of Wild West adventures.

It didn't make any difference that he was a rich, handsome sex god because his character was hard to take. Charlie was an innocent 18 year old who was quickly falling for him. She had lied to Riccardo and said she was 24, so he had no problem taking her virtue. Riccardo leaves his vineyard where he and Charlie were involved for a few weeks. He never told her that he was actually the owner of the place and when he leaves on the pretense of visiting his mother Charlie follows. At this point, she doesn't know she's pregnant with his child but when she arrives at his mothers palatial home both Riccardo and his mother treat her like trash, and she leaves. 8 years later she has to show a large estate to a client and guess who? It's Riccardo and she takes one look and passes out. That was disappointing because for someone who's been playing the radio loudly in the car for the last eight years of her life to block out the memories of Riccardo you would think she would have been thinking what she would do if she ever ran into him again. So she wakes up and yes she tortures the hell out of him but not nearly enough for the pain, he and his mother cost her. However, even with her having somewhat of a back bone and Riccardo being a block head the story and the book were extremely good and just to see Riccardo eat crow at the end was worth the price of the book.

The book proper begins in February, three months of PT later, and as she heads off to the Poconos to join her Mate and his Pack.- Includes excerpts fromForsaken Talismanby Ashleigh Raine,Called by Bloodby Evie Byrne, andVery Much Aliveby Dana Marie Bell.- There are two ""free read""s available on the author's website giving us a little epilogue of Rick and Belle - ""Little Red"" and ""'Twas a Coyote Christmas"".- The Poconos Pack have their own series. First bookFinding Forgivenessis m/m and tells the story of Ben Malone (Marshall) and Dave Maldonado (Beta).Opinion:Another good, solid story in Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series, linking the Pumas with her new series on the Poconos Pack. It's certainly interesting and opens a whole new avenue of shifter romances. Tossing in some telepathy and a holiday resort, it should make a good new series.As far as ""Steel Beauty"" goes, it's a nice romance. Belle proves herself to be everything a Luna should be - strong, caring, intelligent - and Rick is a lovely Dominant Alpha with a loving streak. It is an easy paranormal romance with explicit bedroom scenes and a HEA. It fits well into the series.""Little Red"":When Rick finds the costume Belle left him for the Halloween party, he's just about ready to kill her. But when he saw her, and the additional goodies, he knew this would be a very memorable party.A little story emphasising the joy in Bell's stories, especially once we have our HEA with caring, happy, respectful, loving h and H. It's sweet, erotic, and very original. Definitely worth a look.""'Twas a Coyote Christmas"":Rick tells Belle a Christmas story to ease her pain.Sometimes an author just wants to pop in on her characters and give her readers a little smile - and that's exactly what this is. There's nothing too it except maybe a little introduction to some of the characters in future Poconos books. But that's okay. it's a few pages to make you smile.-CR-","05 4, 2012",A1ZN2JLLR9GI3T,cathyr,1336089600

By that time I also didn't particularly care for the main character, though I liked her older son. I found the constant references to the missing husband rather irritating, especially since the author doesn't tell us who Alexi was until his mystery-shrouded name had been sprinkled through the text five times.  One reviewer liked the lack of explanations in the book, but I don't enjoy passages that make me feel like the author is trying to play games with my head.  If the character doesn't know something, I'm OK with not knowing it, but pages of gloomy ""Alexi is missing"" with no explanation of who he was to warrant this attention made me grouchy.  I skipped to the end to confirm my guess and didn't feel any need to fill in the missing chapters. Overall, the author uses words well, and I'm sorry that I didn't find the book more compelling.","12 14, 2012",AP66BKZNZHKCU,"J. Zartman ""author of Rory, King of Petla""",1355443200

Sawyer is sweet, sexy as hell and romantic and smitten, Morgan is so hot for Misty, he can't get enough, I loved the part where Morgans Naked in the kitchen and Honey makes him dress...too funny.For both Honey  and Misty the men break down their defenses and builds them back up, even though all claim to love being bachelors they get a case of the love bug. Another great series to follow. Can't wait for Casey's storyGabe/Jordan although liked Sawyer and Morgan in buckhorn beginnings more, this sequel is good. Very sexy men, courageous women.

Is it Glasgow, London, Manchester, a little fishing village in Scotland, I don&#8217;t know.So many of the stories failed to reach an ending or make any sense whatsoever. You&#8217;ve got one guy who starts the story by getting a right spanking off a few blokes, but we never find out why or what led up to it. He ends up beating a drug dealer up, tying his hands and feet together and then placing his feet through a pair of gymnast&#8217;s rings! How does he manage that when they&#8217;re tied together?

He&#8217;d just drop to the floor.We get another fellow who&#8217;s the butt of a joke at a roof party &#8211; I&#8217;m trying desperately not to be a &#8216;spoiler&#8217; here &#8211; with the words, &#8220;Should have known who&#8217;d been holding the it an&#8217; all&#8230;&#8221; and I&#8217;ve no idea what that means. Anyway he takes the opportunity to attack two of his antagonists from behind and push them off the roof stating, &#8220;I held onto their belts for a moment until I had to let go.&#8221; WHAT! He held onto their belts for a moment? Assuming they weighed approximately the same as him, he&#8217;s holding twice his own weight with no anchorage whatsoever. It would pull him straight off the roof too.This is another story that just stops. A crowded party, everyone would have either witnessed him do this or seen the bodies falling through the air and looked round at him. But no, the story just stops right there. It&#8217;s rubbish!Too often we&#8217;re left to guess at the ending. Two young boys playing on a beach hear a choir, a sure sign that there&#8217;s been loss of life at sea, and then their mother doesn&#8217;t turn up for tea. Are we supposed to assume she&#8217;s dead? She certainly wasn&#8217;t lost at sea. I didn&#8217;t know what to make of that story at all.Then there&#8217;s the story of three white lads attacking and raping Muslim women. It seemed to jump about all over the place, going back in time and introducing (I think) six Muslim men that I kind of lost track as to who was who.Nigel Bird seems a genuine chap, who&#8217;s very serious about his writing, and I feel awful offering such a poor review, especially as he&#8217;s evidently working so hard, but I have to be honest. I think his writing is actually quite good but his plots are rubbish. They have little more imagination than an average schoolboy. They start out of nowhere, in the middle of a plot, and finish abruptly when the reader knows full well there&#8217;s going to be consequences for the actions taken at the end.Every story is incomplete.

Logan and Rhys are married to Catherine.  They are hard workers and devoted to their growing sucessfull business, but this is the reason that their wife Catherine is unhappy.  It seems the guys have been so single-minded in their pursuit of success that they have been neglecting poor Catherine.  On their anniversary she plans a romantic dinner at a restaurant so that she can tell them that she is pregant with their child.  They guys get caught up in a business problem and forget the dinner date.  They have to fly out to solve the problem and also cancel a planned Jamaican vacation with Catherine.  This is the last straw for Catherine and she heads to Jamaica without them.  When they discover that she isn't waiting for them at home, they realize just how much they have hurt her and fly to Jamaica to try to win her back.  This was a very romantic menage story.  The guys are hot and the reader realizes that they work hard for Catherine because the three began their lives together very humbly.  Catherine makes them realize that nothing is as important as their relationship together.  The changes they make to their workaholic lifestyles reveal the extent of their love for Catherine and results in a very touching, and sexy story.

There's no steam, no heart pounding will he or won't he. The scene where the two finally get together is so late in the book it could have been passed over completely.

This book marks a nice departure from standard zombie fare, while retaining enough of the genre to keep that nice post-apocalyptic feel that zombies are so good at providing.  While I like the single-minded focus of your average zombie, I found that the idea of a few smart zombies thrown into the mix added to the sense of peril.  It appears that most of the typos referenced in other reviews have been corrected and I thought that the book was well-written, suspenseful and even funny at times.

7988,B0035LDNZK,"[1, 2]","Two books into the Prophecy trilogy, and I can assure you, just about everything is. Awkward, I mean. No, I'm not criticizing or expressing my feelings about the book (though that's coming), I'm saying that the word ""awkward"" has popped up so frequently in both this book and the previous one that I'm getting the feeling it's a preferred adjective. Unfortunately, the problem isn't that it's used so often. For me the problem is that because it's used so often, it limits the variety of the descriptives and left me with a very repetitive and one dimensional impression of characters reactions. But now I'm getting ahead of myself...The second book in Heaton's Prophecy trilogy picks up almost directly after the upsetting cliffhanger of the previous book. Unlike some series, this trilogy does not contain stand alone books, and the exposition here is virtually non-existent. If you have not read Prophecy: Child of Light, I wouldn't recommend you try to start this one. In this book, Prophecy is shaken by the mistakes made in Child of Light, and feeling very lost and small as she struggles in Valentine's absence. Along with the surprising help of the new lord of Trenebrae, Venturi, who has sworn to protect her...despite her being responsible for the death of half his family's warriors and his lord and sire, Prophecy marches ever onward, determined to rescue her love despite the obstacles that keep popping up, and still set on being the savior, not the destroyer, of the world.I tend to agree with the other reviewers to a point. I think Prophecy: Caelestis & Aurorea is a bit better written than Prophecy: Child of Light. I can't really say, however, that I liked it more than Child of Light, because in fact, I didn't. One of the things I enjoyed so much in the first book was the slow development of Valentine's character - the changes he goes through as he turns from centuries of service and family dedication to do this rash thing by following his instincts. I found his particular journey and the developing relationship with Prophecy to be compelling.This book loses most of that, and instead offers up a potential rival for Prophecy's affections in the character Venturi. I'm not going to criticize the author's artistic license, because that's not my place. I'll simply say that the quagmire of the emotional triangle that was developed here was not to my taste. I personally found it a bit disturbing and it didn't leave me feeling much sympathy for Prophecy.I know I'm particularly hard on the female heroines in my books. Most books I read, if I can get through them just able to tolerate the female lead, I consider it a good day. I haven't been crazy about Prophecy from the beginning of the series, but I liked where I thought she was going, who I thought the character was developing into. For a good portion of the first part of this book, either while she was with Venturi or while she was making her way to save Valentine mostly on her own, I was forced to realize that without Valentine to hold my attention, I just don't like her. I think she's far too unschooled, impetuous, and immature. She's lucky that she seems to breeze through things with little to no true conflict and that she's been given all kinds of power and foresight, because she doesn't appear to have much inherent sense. And I don't understand how this young girl - who hadn't even ever left her family house or hunted just weeks ago - is so easily and with so little effort able to command such powerful magics and defeat such powerful foes when the odds and numbers are so drastically against her. It's a bit unrealistic.All in all, I thought the plot of this book meandered a bit too much, especially at the beginning, lost its focus for the first half, and had too much emphasis placed on developing some sort of odd love triangle that just flat out turned me off and made me lose a lot of respect for Prophecy. I can't say I disliked it, really, because there's much about this journey that Prophecy and Valentine are on that I like very much, but I didn't like it as much as the first book.  For me it lacked in intensity, and while the technical writing skills and grammar issues were less prevalent here, I'm still left feeling like overall, this book was just...awkward.","05 23, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",1274572800

This is basically a love story about a physically & mentally damaged guy who has pretty much stayed in the shadows due to his deformity. That doesn't stop him from getting what he wants - whether success in the financial world or his share of women. His main thing is not letting anyone close to him.Well...along comes Katie who has become an object of his desire and lust due to a self-portrait of her that he purchased from the coffee shop she works in. Of course she becomes his current challenge to get her into bed. However, he hasn't ever encountered someone like Katie - she meets him head on in his sexual whims and desires but she is also a pure loving soul who sees past his deformity. She's not out to get anything from him except his love. In the first half of the story, I was a little taken aback by how easily Katie fell into his sexual wishes so soon and sudden. Cain came across a bit like a stalker, lurking in the night - but it was understood that he preferred the darkness of the night so he could hide his deformity. He also came across as hot and cold and it was puzzling to Katie.Of course since he doesn't believe he is deserving of her love, he initially pushes her away with cruel and cold words. But credit has to be given to Katie - she didn't slink away or let his mean words push her away..initially. I kept thinking that if someone said those means things to me, I would have been gone in a flash. But because she didn't let his words push her away, he started to see the relationship in a different light. But of course his demons kept coming out and eventually it did accomplish in pushing her away.The second half of the story was simply a realization. It takes a true love to take you out of the darkness and into the light...but only if you can see it in yourself that you are worthy of being loved. Love isn't easy - when you find that love you have to hold on. And that's what Cain comes to realize in the end. The book started off with light BDSM and turned into a deeper story of love.","03 5, 2013",A2KIGHDI97HZE5,Cameogirl,1362441600

10483,B002DOSBO8,"[0, 0]","4 starsI really enjoyed this story. I liked Lark and Taran and was happy when they worked out their issues and got together. The story was short but it didn't feel as short as I know it was. I didn't feel like anything was missing or it was rushed, the author did a very good job with it. I've read the series before and really enjoyed all 3 books but it's been a while so I felt the need for a reread.Lark is a court reporter and is sweet but also has a bit of a sarcastic mouth at times. She's also in love with her cousin, Taran. Now don't get all freaked...there's no blood relation and they weren't raised together or anything. But he's always been like a big brother to her and he also happens to be a werewolf (which are publicly known in this &#34;world&#34; along with the Fae). Since he's never shown any interest in her as anything more than an annoying little sister/cousin type person, she's gone on with her life and tried to live it but she can't help but long for him. She never expected his true feelings were much different than what he showed her.Taran is an alpha werewolf (but not the Alpha of the local pack, more of a lower ranked alpha within the pack) and a police officer with a shifter task force. He's a good guy and I liked his character. Since Lark grew to maturity, Taran's been attracted to her more than her felt he should be and when he realized she was his destined mate 3 years before, his life went to hell. Taran is convinced that Lark sees him as nothing but an annoying older brother type and wouldn't welcome any advances from him. He's also sure their family would freak even though they're not blood relation so he's kept his feelings secret and suffered with being so close but yet so far from his mate.Lark and Taran get thrown together in a traumatic way when Lark is almost kidnapped by some werewolves that are stealing women to sell in to sexual slavery. Taran saves her but that doesn't end the issue. When she goes home, Taran stakes out her place to watch over her and is barely able to stop another attack on her. He then has to take her home with him to ensure she stays safe. Things go smoothly for a few days, with Tarn mostly avoiding Lark, but eventually things come to a head and they both recognize the attraction between them and engage in a night (and morning) of hot sex. Taran doesn't tell Lark right away that she's his mate though and when she finds out he held that back, she's upset and ends up leaving and staying with a friend until she can think things out. Taran, regardless of the fact he thinks she's rejecting him outright, makes sure she's guarded at her friend's house to prevent any further attacks on her.While things are no going well with Lark, Taran works on making progress on his case trying to get the person responsible for the kidnapping of the women. He makes some progress but not much. He does break down and call Lark (leaving her a great voicemail) which helps the situation greatly and she calls him back (also leaving a voicemail but at least they're talking). Around this time, one of his leads for the case bottoms out in a way that indicates he's got a leak somewhere. He figures out who it most likely is but it also ends up this person is in a position to harm Lark. This leads to some stress and drama but Lark and Taran come through alright in the end (although the main bad guy isn't caught and this case comes back in to the series in book #3). Lark and Taran end the story with some more hot sex and the start to a good HEA.I really liked this story. The characters aren't perfect but they're pretty good and likable. I thought the story was well written, not feeling as short as it actually was. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. I'd recommend this book.

I want to say the first book was either free or pretty cheap or I could have even splurged and purchased it. However it was discovered, I ended up purchasing the other two in the series because I became obsessed! I was disappointed when I had to wait for the fourth book in the series but I found out a little later that it was put on hold because of personal reasons. I hoped everything was ok and kept checking back. But imagine my surprise when I just found out recently the fourth was released in October of 2013!! And Sydney herself asked if I would like to review it. So I offered to re-read the first three and review the whole series here. So this is where we find ourselves here now, on the second day of our Sydney Somers week. (If you missed it yesterday, we had an exclusive cover reveal for a novella prequel to her Pendragon Gargoyles series. I even had the privilege of designing it!!!) So enough about my babble and let's get to the good stuff. :)We are immediately pulled into the story with Kennedy, who is the bartender at Pendragon's which is owned by Tristan and his siblings, threatening to hose down (with the water sprayer behind the bar) the hot to trot Tristan and another patron who were on the way to getting into a fight. I immediately thought, &lt;em>well this is going to be good&lt;/em>. I could tell immediately, even through Kennedy's POV, that Tristan is an alpha from the jump so the hose thing took some lady balls on her part. But this event essentially kicked off the madness and heart pounding events of the story. Kennedy is sucked into the enchanting world of paranormal beings she had no clue existed. And she finds that she can no longer ignore the powerful draw she feels towards the mysterious Tristan. But there is danger that is lurking in the shadows, hanging the threat of death over her head. Talk about a downer.But Tristan is there to do anything he can to keep her safe. Including giving up his chance to unfreeze his brother from his constant gargoyle state. Throw in a bunch of action and some hot lovin', and you've got one guy I totally want at my back...and front. ;) I love a good alpha male but I also love when they are all,&#34;do what I say now woman!&#34; and then the next it's, &#34;you are everything to me.&#34; It's enough to turn me to mush in a hot second. I loved how protective he is of Kennedy. And one part of the story had my heart aching for him and wanting to take all his hurts away. I was rooting hard for the two of them! And I was so happy with the outcome!This story has a ton of action and I loved how the tale of King Arthur and Merlin. My inner history nerd was having a field day with this new spin. It's so creative how everything is woven around some things we know, like the knights of the round table.

There is a very brief beginning in which a young French royal friend of Maxon's (what? I thought he had no friends? Whatever.) sort of throws herself at Maxon and he declines. The story immediately moves to the beginning of the Selection and into familiar territory. All we really read is Maxon's perspective of that familiar story and his interaction with the girls. The only interesting bit in my opinion was getting to see why he sent some of the girl's home during the breakfast ceremony. We also see his first interactions with Kriss, and I guess that was kinda interesting. I still can't give it three stars because I feel that the blurb was very misleading and teased the buyer with something it didn't deliver. Asking us to pay a few more dollars for basically the same exact story told through Maxon's eyes felt cheap and disrespectful.

Young innocent man kicked out of his house must turn to being a whore at a place called the Chicken Ranch to survive, and his first client is a shy hunk with a stutter. So far so good. And the first part of this was nice; I liked the initial scene between the two of them.But from there, things remained relatively flat. Young sets up this hunky but nerdy guy with a stutter, but in the entire book I think he only stutters once, and it&#8217;s not really a problem. I wanted to see more drama, more tension, just more than a saccharin-sweet tale. That&#8217;s pretty much what the book was.

Claymore Beller was an accountant for the Russian mafia, until the day he tried to turn them over to the IRS, resulting in the murder of his entire family, and of Claymore; or so they thought. Claymore's youngest daughter Cynthia survives and makes it her mission to get vengeance on the men who killed her family.Lee Maxwell's family was also killed by the Russian mafia for his own betrayal. He, like Cynthia, yearns to get vengeance for the deaths of his wife and daughter; and upon meeting, they decide to make the mafia pay for their crimes. Law enforcement and the media refer to them as the ""Grudge Ninja"".Owen Dunham has been following the ""Grudge Ninja"" case, but none of the evidence/profiles seem to get him any closer to apprehending the suspects. Until he figures out their motive, leaving him to decide whether the ""Grudge Ninja"" has the right to deal out payback, or if  it's his sworn duty to report them.Review:After reading A.J. Scudiere's Resonance, I was excited to read Vengeance, especially after reading the book blurb. The characters were very unique and well developed, and the plot was definitely solid, two of the many reasons that the book took off as soon as I started reading. I love a good thriller, but most times I find them predictable, so the fact that I was constantly on my toes trying to figure out what was going to happen earned this book huge Brownie points. I also appreciated the level of detail, particularly the grittiness, violence, and gore associated with the pairs' vendetta. I wouldn't be surprised to see this as a movie or as the plot in one of the many crime shows currently on television. This fast-paced thriller is definitely on my recommended list!Rating: On the Run (4.5/5)*** I received this book from Griffyn Ink (JKS Communications) in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","10 29, 2011",A34CKST8ITIORZ,"The Paperback Pursuer ""TPP""",1319846400

However, even though parts of series and more could be related for knowing previous - I still believe the stories I have read in this series can stand alone.  Which I prefer as I hate to be beholden to reading serial type works.  Good show that as (seeming these days) I run into many that really require all be read and in order.In this one we find Argus a college graduate, a loner who comes into a mysterious package thrust on him at busstop.  The tale unfolds as Argus and his co -worker and roommates try to figure out what the package contents mean and why/how related to Argus.  Again, this author shows creative abilities with his premise and the pieces that seem random - but ultimately tie together.  This one is related to a supernatural place and supernatural events.  As is the other one I read (likely all four are).  The supernatural bits are not overdone or ""hokey "" to this reader and while it seems to jump around a bit - I believe this is due to various people working their part of the puzzle and author intent versus just jumping around without cohesive plot planned.I really enjoy reading this author's work.

Caitlin is a Ph.D. doing research.  Avery sends a message to Alex requiring him to assist Caitlin and to let her interview and observe police officers for a week.  Alex hates it, but he grudgingly allows it.  He takes her to lunch.  They begin to fall for each other.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I don't recommend it.  It's not nearly as good as her other books.  There are two stories going on, and both are lacking.  The first story is the relationship between Alex and Caitlin.  There is too much pondering and inaccurate assumptions.  Caitlin assumes things which are not true but cause her distress.  A major separation happens because Alex is commitment shy.  It just wasn't interesting.  The second story is about catching the crook Ratso, described below.CAUTION MINOR SPOILER:With evidence from Ratso they can put away major criminal Lopez.  The first time they catch Ratso he tells them he has to go to the bathroom, and then he escapes out a tiny window.  The second time they catch him, he tells a policeman that the cuffs are too tight and hurt.  So the policeman stupidly removes the cuffs.  Then Ratso does something bad.  I was irritated at the cops' stupidity.  And then we don't know if Ratso was wounded or killed or was able to give evidence or what.  That story was completely unfinished.DATA:Kindle count story length: 4326 (a little shorter than a typical romance novel).  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.

It seems like the author wrote too much and it seriously wreaks havoc with the book. Most of the dialogue is exposition with a little character building shoved in wherever it would fit. From the situations that occur and the way they're handled most of the characters come off badly, with few redeeming qualities, and as awfully boring. I can't even remember their names.  As for the plot, what little of it there is revolves around a curse placed on the children of 2 families to cause conflict and a war, thus removing any responsibility the ""good guys"" might have in that horrendous affair. However most of the plot is shoved aside for world building, and while that may be fun for a bit, it gets old real fast. Another thing the more I learn about this world the less I want to read on, It is that unpleasant. There is nothing charming, magical or even realistic about it. This is by far the worst book I've ever read and the only barely redeemable thing about it is the opening. If I could give this zero stars I would.

1618,B002Z7ESPO,"[3, 4]","I downloaded EYE OF THE STORM by Monette Michaels which was a modern action suspense romance novel and enjoyed it so much that I went looking for more of her books and found this one.  While I have expanded my selections of reading material, my first love is Sci/Fi and this satisfied my craving.It is a fast paced Sci/Fi novel with both strong male & female Alpha characters with a lot of fights and battles.  Wulf was the ultimate Alpha male wanting to do nothing but protect his mate but having to come to term with the fact that with her experience & abilities, Melina was not going to stay on the sidelines.  While Melina is a kick-ass heroine and capable of taking down the bad guys she's not invincible and does have to deal with injuries.  Too many times in a novel, the stong Alpha female is shown overcoming the bad guys with only a few bruises to show for it.  In both novels that I have read so far by Monette Michaels, the Alpha females while able to deal with the bad guys are not invincible and are therefore more credible.The world building is fantastic and believable for a Sci/Fi novel.  As for Wulf growling - enjoyed it.  I like a growly Ultra Alpha male.The novel is more actions and a slow build up to the love scenes and I really enjoyed that part.  My problem with this novel is that I was very much wishing that this was just a start to a series and that there were other books because I really want to read more about Wulf's brothers finding their mates.  As of yet, I have not found any more in the series but I'm still looking.Update:  I found the author's web page and found that while this book appeared to be a start of a series that no more books have been published or are in the working stage.  This I found rather disappointing because at the end of this book the reader was set up for the next book regarding one of Wulf's brothers finding and dealing with his mate.  It makes me wonder whether the other book EYE OF THE STORM will suffer the same fate - a great start but no follow up.  This does not take away from the fact that I enjoyed both books but I did find it disappointing.","06 23, 2011",AYZ3XI8VSE6C1,Rare Reviewer,1308787200

This was an awesome thriller with lots of twists and turns that I didn't see coming. I love stories that take me off guard and deal with complex characters that don't seem as if they're who they are, only to turn your expectations of them right on the side.The story deals with Frank Jolino and Ernst ""Stahl"", two expert assassins living on opposite sides of the globe in different lives until one fateful moment of mental interlinking brings them together. Soon each is allowed to view the other's experience as if they were perched on the other's shoulder. Their lives interconnect from jobs to love lives and betrayal while each have something in the balance. With Stahl, his son's life is at stake on the condition that he kills a scientist connected with the SARS disease. With Frank, he is sent to kill his old girlfriend, the long lost niece of his mafia boss who he still is in love with, on suspicion that she is connected with the feds.This was one novel that was hard to put down. Merz excels at creating engaging characters wrapped in a fast paced read. One moment I was sympathizing with them and the other felt the complete opposite. Overall, my nose was in the pages all the way to the very satisfying end.This is a late entry for the best of my 2009 reads and it goes right at the top.

In fact, I will say that it is my favorite book of the series so far.And yes, I read it out of order, I didn't realize until after I'd started. And yes, there were some spoilers, but I still loved it. Father Mine is what happens after Happily Ever After, the story that happens between the ""end"" of Lover Awakened and the epilogue that takes place sixteen months later.I knew that Zsasdist had overcome his past enough to be with Bella, but I was very curious as to how that would play out in his daily life, and with a family.

Janvier has a very bad habit of getting himself in trouble with the angels and doing a disappearing act which means the guild are called in to track him down. Ash has spent years chasing him across the world and through the bayou only for him to always make his peace with the angel who hired her just before she catches him. For once Ash's job isn't to search for Janvier though and this time she actually needs his help, she has been asked to find a kidnapped vampire but the last thing she wants is to be caught up in the politics between two of the vampires who report to the angel Nazarach. Since Janvier is familiar with all of the vampires involved she is hoping he can smooth the way and help her through the situation in one piece.Angel's Pawn is the shortest of the novellas included in this book and it is also the only one where we don't get to see a full on relationship develop between the two main characters. In spite of that it was a really enjoyable read and I absolutely loved the banter between Ash and Janvier. they have great chemistry and I have high hopes for them hooking up at some point as the series progresses - there is no way they can deny their connection forever! Ash has always been on the sidelines (although she does have a larger role in the 4th book Archangel's Blade) so we don't know a huge amount about her but she has some very interesting abilities that I'm looking forward to learning more about in future books. I don't remember actually being introduced to Janvier in the earlier books, he was mentioned but I don't think we ever saw him, so it was great to get a taste of his character too. He is one sexy Cajun with a real playboy attitude but he seems to have met his match in Ash and it looks like he's more than willing to explore their attraction.","06 2, 2013",A2EU9VP0MRMUGE,Sarah (Feeling Fictional),1370131200

9268,B002HRF7WK,"[0, 0]","""How to Write a Great Query Letter"" by Noah Lukeman is an excellent reference guide for how to write an effective query letter. Lukeman is a long-time literary agent, so he knows what agents want to see in a query letter. He is very detailed about how to properly construct a query letter and he covers all the bases.In the book, Lukeman talks about the importance of preparation by thoroughly researching agents. He discusses the best and worst query letter formatting techniques. Then he breaks apart the query letter paragraph by paragraph and explains key features to include and mistakes to avoid - for both fiction and nonfiction. Lastly, he goes over final issues, including common mistakes writers make with their query letters. The end of the book includes a checklist for writers for when they craft their query letter.Even though I'm a self-published author, I can see how this book is a great resource for new writers interested in seeking an agent or publisher. It is evident, that by following the suggestions in the book, the writer will develop a highly effective query letter that is clear, concise, direct, full of the important traits that agents are looking for, and free of nonessential information. I highly recommend this book to writers to read before they query any agents or publishers.","06 10, 2012",A1GKE5MUSYNTLE,Christine Rice,1339286400

9801,B0026REA92,"[7, 7]","This whole idea of chunking a book grates on me. I will NEVER knowingly spend one cent on this type of literature. Basically, they take one book and chop it into 3 or 4 shorter stories with barely there plots.The fact is the cheap books sell better. So by taking a book and breaking it into parts and selling the parts at a couple of bucks each, you get more money and more sales...In my opinion the story suffers and the flow of the experience is corrupted.Seducing Jane Porter passes as a Reader's Digest story. Thin plot. Undeveloped characters. Just seduction, passion, heat that you really can't get into because you don't know the characters well enough to really care at all.Maybe I did get it for free so I should lower my expectations and be grateful, but frankly I gave my book time to this. And frankly, I felt cheated. I want my time back. For $3 or $4 you can read Annabel Joseph's FULL LENGTH BDSM stories.  There are so many amazing BDSM authors and so little time.

It makes sense that a government program wouldn't work, but it also seems that if marriages were ""made"" by the government, people would just choose not to marry.  I don't understand why Rainy applies for marriage when she's fresh out of college and just starting a career.  She tries to blame it on her father's position, but the explanation doesn't really make sense.  I don't understand why she keeps going along with it when she decides she doesn't want to marry the guy.  And, to be honest, I just didn't like her -- or her friends, or her boyfriend.  I agree with the reviewer about the need for proofreading too!  I've seen worse, but this was was pretty bad and, I agree, distracting.  So was the constant, constant use of the F word -- come on people, is this really necessary?  The ending was so, so predictable, but also pretty incomplete.

Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.","07 30, 2011",A5CA9579GD7HJ,Bob Jarvis,1311984000

During snowstorms the route to town from their home is impossible.  Fortunately in lieu of a female during these times Bobby and Cale are more than compatible and have no qualms about helping each other out if and when the need arises.After catching her fianc&eacute; cheating on her again, Katherine Duvall makes the decision to escape the intolerable situation.  She leaves behind her engagement ring, grabs the rental car keys and drives off completely ignoring the bell staff's warning about driving without snow chains in the stormy weather - and that almost proved to be detrimental.Fortunately for Kate, Bobby and Cale are on their way home from town when they notice her vehicle and become concerned because it's obvious she isn't used to driving in snowy weather.  The men follow the other car for ten miles and just when they think she might make it and not slide off into the river it happens - her car fishtails and slides off the road into the freezing water.When it becomes obvious that Kate isn't thinking straight enough to save herself, Bobby goes into the water to rescue her.  It falls to Cale to get Bobby and the woman back to the truck and then to their home where he strips them all down and climbs into bed between them to use his own body heat to warm them up.  He just never anticipated they'd end up sharing so much more - though he certainly isn't complaining!Delilah Devlin's storylines never fail to pull readers into the story and SADDLED is no exception.

1929,B002YQ2JA2,"[5, 6]","So what, aside from the lovely young man on the cover, drew me to read this story? The title, of course! When I picked this novella up, I figured that there was no way that any story titled She's Got Balls could possibly take itself seriously. And I was right. She's Got Balls by Mia Watts is a quick and humorous read that revolves around the running gag of a man in a dress. Or, rather, a man trying to deal with torturous panties and the crimp that they put in his out-of-control libido. This story is cute, funny, sexy, and just plain fun.She's Got Balls features two irresistible heroes that you can't help but love. Both are very manly men, but one of them is doomed to spend a lot of time in a dress. Chris is clever, irreverent, mouthy, pushy and constantly has sex on his mind. He might not want to play the girl, but he throws himself into the role completely and is a very quick study. It's very entertaining to watch him try to be ""one of the girls"" because he is such a man. Vin, who gets to be ""the man"" of their couple because of his size and physique, is actually the kinder and gentler of the two. He tends to hold his emotions close to his chest, and although he puts up a tough-guy front, he has a softer side that is in direct contrast.The interaction between the main characters strikes sparks along with being humorous. These two are definitely an ""odd couple."" Chris's goads Vin incessantly just for the pleasure of watching the man react, calling him Gigantor and suggesting that his momma fed him growth hormones, and all the while he just wants to get into his pants. Vin, despite first impressions, is the more even-keeled of the two. When he decides to make his move, however, he is definitely the one in control of the situation. And oh, what control he has. This man definitely knows how to put a pair of gag-gift fuzzy handcuffs to work for him.I was a little disappointed that the investigation in this story did not receive more attention, because I think She's Got Balls would have benefited from a little more ""meat"" in the story and would have made a more effective novel than novella. The investigation seems more of a vehicle to bring the two main characters together and an excuse to get Chris into drag rather than being a true plot device. Regardless, this is a cute and fun story. It tickled me and made me grin, and I thought it was definitely worth the reading time.","12 4, 2009",A3C2JT2GQGB3E,B. D. Whitney,1259884800

Sky is a rock star, traveling incognito, trying to avoid the paparazzi.  He came to town for a few weeks for some quiet time to write music.  He happens to be in the pub when Teagan performs.  He likes her song and asks her to be a cowriter, working with him to write some songs.  At first she refuses, but then agrees after losing a bet to him about music knowledge.  They spend a lot of time together.  They are sexually attracted to each other.  She is a virgin and wants to wait until she falls in love before having sex.  He respects that, so they play with each other sexually without taking her virginity.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I wasn't surprised or delighted with anything.  The characters, dialogue, and plot were ordinary, nothing new.  It wasn't bad.  I kept reading out of curiosity, but I wasn't drawn in.  Although he is protecting her virginity, he gets into some kinky sexual things right away which was odd.  He ties her hands, spanks her, uses a toy, and includes rear door activity.DATA:Reading time: 2  hours.  Kindle count story length: 2665 (262 KB).

She has never really been comfortable with her life and is completely obsessed with the pirate she's about to put on display. That pirate is James Morrow, who did a lot of his pirating in the early 1700's. Becca was so obsessed with the age and the pirate she even learned how to fence. So, as she's putting the display up, she decides to test a sword that came with all the other items, thus taking her back in time to Captain Morrow's ship. I didn't realize when I purchased Treasured that it was sort of a Time Travel novella. I may not have purchased it had I known, but I am quite happy I did buy and read it!Apparently Becca could basically have been twins with James's wife Rebecca. No one on board liked the original wife and quite frankly she despised them all. Becca, however, fits in better than she ever did in what she had known as her time. It is very amusing how James doesn't understand the sudden changes in his wife. She never liked having sex with him, and didn't like him at all.

Both men are looking to share one woman for the rest of their lives.  That woman turns out to be Clarissa Barnes, a MAIL ORDER BRIDE FOR TWO.Clarissa Barnes had to leave her employment suddenly when she was accosted by her lecherous employer.  With no money and no way to get another job, she agrees to become a mail order bride.  Arriving in South Dakota, she is upset to find out that the man who paid her way West has already gotten married.  Help comes in the form of Logan Granger and Derek Brand.Derek Brand and Logan Granger have been friends their entire lives.  They also have been sharing lovers for quite a while.  Both men have decided that they are tired of being alone, so they have paid a lawyer to head east to find them a mail order bride.  Waiting on her train, the men are anxious but can't wait to become a family of three.  Finding out that their affianced bride jumped off of the train to her death sets heavy on them, but their luck hasn't completely run aground. It seems that the lovely lady who told them about their bride is also husbandless and has been left standing in the train station.  That's when they decide then and there to make her their bride.  All she has to do is agree.MAIL ORDER BRIDE FOR TWO made me blush more than once.  The men, Logan and Derek, are sin personified and totally dreamy.  Their treatment of Clarissa was tender, yet forceful.  They knew they wanted her - they knew she wanted them.  The rest fell into place quite nicely.I am addicted to m&eacute;nage love stories. I can't help it. There is just something about being cherished by two alpha men that just makes me swoon. MAIL ORDER BRIDE FOR TWO by Elle St. James is such a book.

We are treated to some delightful descriptions of the Appalachian Mountain locale that this story is set in and, by the end of the book, I felt that I had entered into the life of the character for a short period of time.The book is relatively short (1800 locations) and a very easy read. If I have any quibble about the book it is that perhaps the plot falls into place too nicely. There were no red herrings or detours to provide that extra element of mystery.I noticed a couple of formatting issues.

When I did though, I could not stop reading.  I liked the character of Julia and I am interested to find out more about Brisbane.  I think switching from UF to this book, more of a historical mystery, was a little jarring and that is why it took me a bit to get into it.  The writing is well done, and while the story is a little slower paced at the beginning, it really picks up at the end and left me wanting more.  Since this was the three-book bundle, I jumped right into the second book!Silent in the Sanctuary - I liked this book more than the first.  The mystery was a bit more interesting and I felt that the pace was a little quicker, which I liked.  Julia and Brisbane continue to be an intriguing pairing and I can't wait to find out more about them.  I really enjoyed the secondary characters in this novel.  I loved the time we spent with Julia's family, especially Portia, and friends.  Fleur is the best.  Morag and Aquinas are also great.  Hopefully Aquinas will be around a little bit more in the next book.  All in all, this is a series I am glad I was introduced to and that I plan to continue reading.Silent on the Moor - I enjoyed this book a little less than the second, but probably as much as the first.  The mystery was a little less important this time around and the pace a little slower, but we did get to meet some interesting new characters.  I really loved Rosalie and how the story of Brisbane's early years turned out.  The Allenbys were one messed up family.  Julia was adorable as always and I loved to see her holding her own with Brisbane even more.  The location descriptions were suitably creepy and I liked the inclusion of the egyptology subplot.

I really love Dohner's New Species series, but I'll have to say that I'm not going to be reading anymore about Zorn Warriors.I can respect Dohner's ability to create dynamic cultures in her books. I read Ral's Woman and decided to give Kidnapping Casey a try, but I honestly wish I didn't. I don't like the culture of Zorn (I can respect Dohner's ability to create it, but it doesn't mean that I necessarily like it). I get that its an Alpha Male borderline D/s world, but the way that Argernon and Casey's relationship played out just wasn't cool for me.I'll have to agree with other reviewers here that rape = rape, yes, even if your rapist brings you to orgasm. I thought it was sweet that Argernon cared about Casey so much. I get that she's a gamechanger for him. I don't like that he tied her up (twice) and after she repeatedly says no (twice), they still end up doing the deed and Casey's all right with it. Oh, and he ties her up afterwards, because he doesn't trust her. And keeps her tied up for days, even making her wear a chastity belt so she can't please herself, and parades around in front of her trying to make her want him. Seems like the Zorn guys are no better than their pointy-eared counterparts, the Collis. I did not like Argernon, because he never learns that it is not ok to kidnap and rape someone. Its not ok to replace 3 girls last minute and expect your new girl to accept you. And Casey just seemed like a silent victim. I felt sorry for her. Somebody said that she was strong and could hold her own... silent strength and holding on to her pain? Yea.I felt like maybe I would've liked this book better if it was drawn out a bit more. Like, I would've liked to see Casey go to Berrr and get unbounded. Then she could've dated and get Argernon to win her love. But whatever. This book is what it is. This is the end of the Zorn for me. I will continue to read about Dohner's New Species and Cyborgs, but I'm not interested in Rever or Berrr.","05 31, 2013",A3K00YXVV65ETA,J. Smith,1369958400

Hot sex, 2 well developed characters who easily grow on you, tender, touching and emotional moments and a nice plot. I prefer this one to Diving Deep, the longer story from Mitchell. The initial setting is really amusing as both characters meet over a rubbish dump. Cade may be the more experienced, flamboyant and older one but his failed relationship with a ""jerk"" has left him vulnerable and lonely. Elliot is a young man, almost a virgin, but romantic at heart believing in finding one true love. They seem very different and you would have thought Cade would have preferred a more exprienced and older lover. But Elliot's persistence and sincerity would win the most hard hearted. Love the chemistry between the 2 men. I would love to read more about this couple making it lasts. A great novella.","07 1, 2008",A1ARJBC8VD5P8P,R.Parklane,1214870400

She finally goes to the castle to get help from a healer and is immediately involvedwith the dragon's knight Sir Marcus and his partner Sir Kaden, Reynor's mate.Lucia is a from the country of Helios, raised by the Jinn, she does not have a commoner background, she has a limited healing ability and is not afraid of dragons.

The three can become a family, if Reynor can be healed and is able to fly again. Learning about Lucia's background and why she doesn't act the part of a serving maid becomes part of her attraction to the two knights.This story was listed as number 4.5 in the series and was only $2.66.

At least, he says he's simply trying to finish a massive project at work and doesn't have any energy once he returns home. Still, that's no reason for him to completely ignore the new lacy bustier or her hot Brazilian way job.  When he does make time for sex, he either falls asleep in the middle of the act or opts for his own solo sessions.  If he's not cheating on her, then he's obviously lost interest in her.  What's a girl to do?At a friend's housewarming party, Melina confesses to a friend that there's trouble in paradise.  Knowing that Melina would never flirt with another man just to make her boyfriend jealous, Abby instead suggests that she flirt with another woman--her.  Flirting soon becomes much more and when Gavin walks in on the two women locked in an intimate embrace, will he finally realize that he's been neglecting his pretty girlfriend or will the girl-on-girl scene be too much for him to handle?Love Me is a well-written, blisteringly sexy short story by author Kelly Jamieson. It explores the fantasy many women have of loving another woman, even if for only one night.  The concept of daily living getting in the way of intimacy and paying attention to one's mate is hardly an unrealistic concept.  However, while flirting with and acting upon a flirtation with someone of opposite sex is considered infidelity in this story, it seems to showcase the message that sex with a same-gender partner is not.Having read other words of lesbian or bi-sexual romance, I was looking forward to an entertaining read. I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the cavalier way that infidelity was handled. Fully recognizing that this is a work of fiction, I still had difficulties believing that these two people could not communicate to each other their own wants and needs.  What's more, due to that lack of communication, under the guise of making her boyfriend jealous, the heroine went to another woman to have them met, even if the encounter began as a simple flirtation.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews ([...])","01 15, 2012",ATNPFCCWHQWJJ,"Bella March ""Bookaholic, Book Reviewer""",1326585600

2561,B002RHP4N2,"[2, 3]","Plot/Storyline: 4 StarsThis was an extremely imaginative tale that takes place mostly in the dream world of Nod. There is even a surprising explanation for why it is called `Nod.' Although this is listed as a YA novel, it is just as enjoyable for adults, if not more so. Younger readers would possibly miss many of the subtle nuances of the work.At first, the switching of viewpoint from omniscient to first person was a little awkward. Cole, the father of twins, is reading a book to them that is written by his father, Jake. The book he is reading is told in first person, and relates a tale from Cole's childhood. The portions featuring the `adult Cole' become scarce after the first quarter, though, making for a smoother read.I felt that having Jake write his book from a first person perspective, but relate in detail events he was not personally privy to, gave the story an unrealistic feel. Yes, the tale is a fantasy and, therefore, not realistic at all. However, this aspect leant a fictional quality that is negated later in the work.Cole's explanation for why he did not call Jake ""Dad"", or something similar, was bothersome to me. The story did not really explain why or when Cole switched to calling his father by his name. I figured that he must have called him `Daddy' when a baby as the adults would have ensured this. His brother, Sean, calls Jake, ""Dad."" So, the explanation Cole gives his sons seemed like something contrived by an adult to earn points with his kids, rather than something based in reality, especially given the story he reads to them with his father's part in it.Although the story takes place mostly in the `dream world', it is pointed out that Sean and Cole have physical bodies there and can be hurt or killed. However, when Sean breaks his leg, he still manages to run, jump, climb ladders, etc. I tried hard to overlook this and succeeded for the most part, thinking that perhaps his leg wasn't actually broken, just sprained or something. However, being told that Sean still limps as an adult reinforced the idea that the leg was broken.This was a fairly fast paced novel with many action sequences. I especially enjoyed the stories injected into the storyline. They were a good fit and very interesting.Oddly enough, my favorite characters were the cows from the trampoline scene.  I don't know why, but that image just stuck with me.Character Development: 4 StarsJake is a very well-developed character. The reader can really feel his emotions coming through. I have to admit that I found it difficult to feel much sympathy for a man who abandoned his children, but sympathy did come into play for him being a widower.Cole could have been developed more as the reader really doesn't get much explanation for what he is really feeling. As a child, we understand that he loves his brother, but we don't get a feel for how this boy feels about having his mother die and being abandoned by his father. This is not expressed well from the adult Cole's viewpoint, either.Sean is very well developed from the childhood view. I did wish that he would have made an appearance as an adult, but, even though that never happened, I was still satisifed with the development of his character.Writing Style: 4 3/4 StarsThe writing style of Mr. Marlowe had a wonderful flow to it that kept me enthralled throughout. The descriptions were vivid, bringing the dream world to life.Aside from a very few dangling participles and awkward sentences, the structure was outstanding. The dialogue was realistic and engaging. The action sequences were also very nicely done with no confusion for the reader. I could actually see the action unfolding in my mind as I read (especially those cows).Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 StarsThere were a few too many editing errors to refer to this as `professionally edited'; however, it did not fall very short.The formatting was excellent.Rating: PG-------------------------------For more information and reviews, including commentary by authors, be sure to check out my blog.

The Guild  hunters are human bounty hunters hired by angel masters to retrieve errant vampire servants attempting to skip out on the hundred years of service that is the price angels charge for immortality.Singh has carved out a nice little vignette for this story and she does a really good job of fleshing out her starring pair:  Guild Hunter Ashwini, who is dangerous and a bit on the crazy side, and Ashwini's favorite target, Cajun vamp Janvier who is her ally and not her prey for this hunt. Both these characters were wonderful and the flirtation between the two makes me hope that Singh won't wait too long to give them a full length novel of their own since Angel's pawn is just a tease for the pair and their relationship is left ` to be continued'.  This lack of closure for Ashwini and Janvier gives Angel's Pawn more of an urban fantasy feel than Singh's Psy-Changlings though.I happened to read Angel's Blood first  and I don't want to spoil that for you, but the one comment that I will make is that Angel's Pawn has a different feel than Angel's Blood - Angel's Pawn only hints at the darkness of this new series and the beauty, danger and cruelty that is part of the ancient angels' natures.

And like several of the books in this series, the style is a little more serious than most of her other stuff I've read.It was a good story, but not a traditional romance. The heroine survived a horrid childhood by becoming a tough a**. This isn't just talk, a character description that really has no bearing on the boy-meets-girl plot. She lives the life: collects martial arts black belts, participates in war games, only has one female friend, etc. She also has a series of jobs (that we only hear about, don't really see) that can be dangerous, even violent. Her initial interest in the hero is because he is better than she is at fighting, and she wants him to teach her.There was just one thing that bothered me. From the start, the hero recognized that he had to keep the heroine off balance to hold her attention. So, all their interactions for most of the book were studied on his part. In one scene, for instance, he doesn't compliment her on her appearance when first he sees her, because she would be expecting it. He does so later in the evening, when it's a surprise. This might seem minor, but how honest is he in their getting to know each other, when all his actions and conversation are geared to unsettling her?It's different, but well done.","07 4, 2011",AGTF8KS70RHCW,Terracotta Dove,1309737600

It is pretty much all relationship-driven as Gabe tries to work out what he did wrong, and Sarah tries to forgive him. But too much of it just didn't gel for me, from Sarah being really, really hurt, and then rapidly forgiving him, to her inability or unwillingness to use her Super Senses to just work out what the heck is going on!!! And there seemed to be a big chunk of the book missing while Gabe went off to learn to be a Hunter. Is this a teaser to yet another series? Otherwise, it felt like an artificial roadblock put in the way of their happiness.On the plus side, I loved the karaoke scene, really enjoyed visiting with past characters, and thought the trip to Disney World was a nice touch. The bdsm aspects were tastefully done and Sarah and Gabe are very sweet together.Bell has set in motion her new ""Halle Shifters"" series as she introduces more shifter types into Halle.

It is nice to see her World developing, from coyotes in New York to Wolves in Poconos and now Bears and Foxes in Halle. It looks like an interesting, complex paranormal world.

The books are reasonably short and mostly relationship-driven, with small dramatic plots to keep the stories running.  But in the end I just wasn't enamoured of this one.

4024,B001QIGZR2,"[19, 21]","I wasn't familiar with author Joe Hill's writing, so I figured this Kindle Single would be a good introduction, and it was. ""The Black Phone"" is one of the stories in Hill's book 20th Century Ghosts. [Note: the Amazon book description is for four different stories; only the last description that begins with ""John Finney..."" applies to ""The Black Phone.""]In the story, John Finney has been abducted by a man dubbed by the media as the Galesburg Grabber, a fiend who has already kidnapped and murdered several kids in the area. John found himself alone in a dark, cold basement that held only a toilet and--surprisingly--an old wall-type telephone that wasn't even connected. As John lost hope and despaired of his fate, he heard the old telephone ring. Was it his frightened imagination, or was someone else really on the line?I enjoyed the story very much. The storyline could have led to some explicit nastiness by the villain, but it didn't. After steadily building up tension, the story's climax was a surprise, but in the context of the story, it was a logical ending. To say anything more would be a spoiler.In a surprise twist, the author has hidden a second story, ""Scheherazade's Typewriter,"" in the acknowledgments after ""The Black Phone,"" so you're actually getting two stories with your download. ""Scheherazade's Typewriter"" was a very short but clever story that gave a new meaning to the word ""ghostwriter""!","05 13, 2012",A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,J. Chambers,1336867200

5406,B001UE7D0K,"[5, 5]","This book could easily carry another subtitle: How to Train Your Brain! According to the author there's a simple way to do that: Mind Mapping.If someone ever told me that there was a way for me to start reading faster than I already do, I'd say that he was crazy. And if I'd never read this book I'd insist he was. However in the book at hand I've discovered a simple example, which I'll call for the purposes of this review 'Reading by the Dot,' that left me speechless. Thanks to it I did not only read a paragraph in great speed, but I've also memorized almost every word of it.It is widely known that every person uses only a limited amount of his mind's capabilities. This book offers the reader a chance to enhance his reading and learning experiences, and improve his memory as well.As we read in the introduction: ""A Mind Map is a diagram you create to organize your thoughts. In conventional note-taking, you write information down line by line or perhaps column by column. Mind Mapping differs from such note-taking in that you present the information more in the form of a diagram.""And how does that help me? one would ask. Well, for starters, I'd answer, it helps with your memory since it is easier to remember images than words. Visualization is the key word here. Kids, just as much as the adults, do not have many difficulties in remembering images but when it comes to words it's a different story.One of the examples that the author uses to prove his point is the diagrams he uses to create an overview of the popular novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Through these diagrams we follow the book from point one all the way to the end, taking a good look at the characters and their interactions, and thus get a brief yet detailed view of the story. ""One idea is interconnected with many other ideas,"" we read, and, as we well know, one person is interconnected with many other persons, which helps prove the point.Mind Mapping has many advantages; it balances the brain, simplifies life, helps with creativity, and speeds up the learning processes. It also has some disadvantages though since it asks of you to change your habits, to spend time to get to know how it works, and maybe creates some minor problems when it comes to speaking since language is an auditory process. The former though overrule the latter, since learning how to operate with Mind Maps can help you change your life for the better in many ways.""...essentially, there's no limit to how vast your Mind Map can become. A subtopic in the first Mind Map you create may become the central idea in the next one you draw. Each subtopic in a map is in effect a center of another map. This is the beauty of the technique--relationships may go on as extensively as they exist in your mind."" Now, how interesting is that!To be honest before reading this book I knew next to nothing about how Mind Mapping works. I've read things about it here and there, but I'd never thought to give it a try. Well, all that has changed. I now find this subject as intriguing as they come. As someone who reads dozens of books every year, and always wishes to read even more, I believe that adopting the technique of Mind Mapping will help me achieve my goals. I think that if I should come to master it the results could be, if nothing else, highly satisfying.Mind Mapping can help one in many walks of life: from organizing vacations to creating business plans, from generating presentations to solving everyday problems, and the list goes on and on.A lot of people say that everything is in our head; the book at hand proves them right. And then it highlights the way one has to follow to reach his own high point, to widen his horizons.If you'd ask me to put this book in a category I wouldn't know which one to choose. Is it a self-help manual? In a way it is, but it's much more than that. To use a metaphor I'd say that this is a guide of how to use the GPS of your brain to find the destinations you desperately seek, and need.","12 4, 2012",A31R6P1KDBJQDV,Lakis Fourouklas,1354579200

Unless they're impersonating Snoop Dogg on SNL.

As I said originally, the premise of this book is intriguing, I was all set and determined to love this book.  Some of the character development was a little jerky and the constant waffling by the Maria character was just downright annoying.  She is the main reason that I originally stopped reading the book, but there were other decisions made with characters that were puzzling or overly sterotyped: did we really need another athiest/pedophile priest?I have seen other reviewers say that reading the other books in the series brings everything together and that they were happier after seeing the work as a whole, so I will go on to the next book and see how it goes from there.  I am one of those people who HAS to finish a book, so the fact that I was ready to give up on it at 80% of the way though says a lot.  The last 20% of the book was much better than the middle of it was!I do have to say that I didn't notice very many typos, as another reviewer stated, though there were some statements that had me stuck for a while.  At one point, a woman is said to have a ""thick African-American accent.""  What the heck is that?  As an African-American, I wasn't aware of us having our own accent, we tend to go with the accent of the region we live in, so maybe the author meant African, or West African or something like that.

While on vacation in Montana,  Millie meets Johnny and it's lust at first sight.  But, Johnny is the type of guy Millie's father would never approve of for his daughter.

I liked the concept of this book but really Cooper was way too whiny for me to be able to deal with.  I still enjoyed the dark and crude humor that carried over from the first book but I didn't really care for the overall story or character development for this one.  It felt really flat for me and I didn't feel any real emotion at the end of the story.  I was just kind of glad I didn't have to read about Cooper anymore, he was just so annoying.  My thoughts on Cooper, however, had nothing to do with his love for computers or that his heaven is inside a computer.  Heaven is whatever you make it so I understand their ""ruling"" that Cooper is OK with where he is because at least he's moved on.  I love the idea that the author wrote this story about a total nerd who is so into video games.  But being a gamer myself and knowing many people who play the types of games that are referenced in this book, I found the stereotype gamer used in this story to be pretty insulting.  Linda, however, was awesome and I loved her reactions to the stupidity that was Cooper.  Because of that I completely related to her, I seriously just wanted to strangle Cooper through the whole story.  Too bad he was already dead.Conclusion:Least favorite out of the three by far but would recommend it if you enjoyed the first one and would like to continue reading about Linda.  Reading about her character alone makes up for my lack of interest in Cooper and for $.99 it really is worth it.","07 31, 2012",A339OOXD57KATK,"Crazie Betty ""N Vanderhoof""",1343692800

Very distracting.-  It starts great but then the story gets a bit slow, many parts lack substance. Sometimes shorter is better than many pages that add nothing to the plot.Lastly, just for those who prefer clean romances:  this one is categorized as romance and many reviewers described it as a sweet read. It is indeed sweet but it is a reading for adults as it has explicit sex scenes including anal sex  ( there is a warning in the book description about this, but too short so it might be missed )","06 3, 2014",APFZA56X7OV1C,Veronica,1401753600

The story started strong though and was definitely worth the effort. I had to remind myself that in the age and place of Nicole's world, children grow up a lot faster than my four. They have a maturity necessary for the hardships they will face.Aislinn came off strong and determined from the very beginning. I loved that she knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to go after it even though it was not the accepted norm for her country. Many times she was so stubbornly focused on her goal that she missed or ignored certain aspects of a child's life. This was one of the things that made her so real to me. I could relate to that stubborn focus.I also loved how she matured over the years. One of my favorite scenes is when she breaks down in tears over the death of a young girl. It is a great moment when you realize what a caring woman she has grown into on top of her strength as a knight in training. The balance and realism is expertly crafted. A true example of how to show who your character is and not telling.There is also a sweet romance woven through this book. I didn't feel like it was the main focus, but the back and forth between these characters is so natural you can't help but be swept away by it.

I love all the characters and the author's ability to keep us updated on everyone in each story.  I can see how it may branch off to other stories about neighboring packs and new characters.  Gabe and Sarah's story was ultimately very sweet and romantic.  However, it was unusually different from the other stories about the Halle Pumas, in that they did not really get together until the end of the book.  That part was really difficult for me because all the rest of the stories have them joining together early on.  This was one big fat misunderstanding and a jumble of wrong decisions on Gabe's part.  It was painful to watch how they continually hurt each other.  I'm not sure, considering how sensitive the ""mating need"" is among these characters, that the hurts that took place would have been so easy to overcome as quickly as they were.  I truly hurt for Sarah and her friend and hated Chloe for the games she was playing.  I was glad Sarah was able to ""share"" her hurt feelings with Gabe so he could truly feel what he put her through. (that part will become clear to you when you read it)...But all in all, I really love this author.  Love this series.  I will continue to read them.  I'm a loyal fan.

Book 1 of the series. It's a quick read, a simple story, easily forgotten, but you'll enjoy it while you've got it- like cotton candy. Also like cotton candy there will be moments when you want to roll your eyes at how incredibly sweet (or corny) it is. There is no hard, brutal edge to this story.PLOT: There really isn't one and for a day at the beach, that's ok. You're looking for para-romance, then this will cover it. Not really erotica- the sex is simple and straightforward, but HOT all the same.CHARACTERS: Stereotypical- dominant male, sassy, but smaller female protected by big brothers. No development.BOTTOM LINE: This isn't a great book, but it will get you there. If you are looking for something reassuring where the nice guys win, there's hot sex involved and the characters can turn into big angry lions with huge teeth, then this is for you. But don't look for anything other than that.RECOMMENDATIONS: (these are all pretty basic shifter-centric para-romance)1. R.G.

I would've liked if the authors gave a brief recount of why earth is now the ""old earth"" and what led up to the change.  I was disappointed in the old time view on a women's worth and arranged marriages.  The heroine was wishy-washy and a pathetic excuse of a women who let's a guy walk all over her, an undeserving and immature guy at that.  For being so far into the future and technologically advanced, the book's society seemed no better than our ancestors of 500 years ago.  In truth, this story focused more on the character's relationship than the potentially exciting world the Ilona Andrews team could've built.  The sex took up a lot of this novella and it was mediocre at best, and clearly one of the two duo has a breast fetish.I love the Ilona Andrews duo, their Kate Daniels series is exceptional and the Edge series, while more romance oriented than I usually like, is still fantastic!  Never would've thought I'd be rating any of their books this low, but.......here we are.To my fellow dark urban fantasy readers, regardless of my gripes this novella had some rays of interest and wasn't entirely bad, but it wasn't engaging and spellbinding either.

I liked the main male character, an Oregon professorial candidate specializing in the flora and fauna of Oregon. What was most interesting, though, was the concept of a race from the stars who are intelligent, gentle, and devoted to one another. Very nice. I know some were frustrated by the fact that Kent took to Povre so easily. Hey, get a grip, people! It is a story - a very sweet story of the most unusual kind of 'cross-racial' relationship. Extremely cross-racial, as in cross-species. But how is that any more questionable than the whole ""woman meets vampire/werewolf/demon/angel"" thing that is so popular these days? I love those, too! The idea that a human botanist/biologist could find an endangered alien and not want to cut her up? Pretty cool concept.

When he caught scent of Ruby Halloway, saw her bent over a file cabinet in his company, he knew he wanted her desperately and thought she may be the one. Ruby, who has had a crush on Leo for ages, did what any shy girl would do when the object of her deepest desire focused on them...she ran away and hid.For a year she's avoided him. For a year he's watched her and tried to get close. Finally, with the help of her best friend and all the charm he can muster, the alleged playboy gets Ruby right where he wants her, and when he tastes her lips for the first time he knows he was right. She's his. And there will be no more hiding or running.Unfortunately, just finding his true mate isn't enough. He's still got to tell her he's fae, explain to her his Sidhe mother and leprechaun father. Gently introduce her into a world she couldn't possibly even dream about and explain the benefits and consequences. Before he can even get close to approaching that daunting task, however, his father calls with somber news. A rival family has kidnapped his brother and is holding him ransom. Leo doesn't need to ask what ransom they're asking for his brother's release. He already knows.They want him.Dana Marie Bell has kicked off this new series with a lot of potential and the backbone of an intriguing world and fun mythos, populating it with personable characters and a couple of neat plot twists. I've long been a fan of Bell and have read and enjoyed her Halle Pumas and Halle Shifters (looking for more of that one!) series, and am familiar with her writing style and characterizations. I particularly enjoy the humor that she injects and how adeptly she partners humor with stressful, sometimes threatening situations, to the benefit of the story as a whole.She's done that here in Dare to Believe: The Gray Court, Book 1. I enjoyed Leo and was charmed by Ruby, who, despite her shyness and some issues with body image, was an appealingly silver-tongued quipster who was good for a cute, humorous line. Some of Bell's greatest strengths as an author lay in her abilities to write fun, bantering dialogue and provide appealing and individual character definition around a solid story concept or idea.The depth and breadth of the plot suffers, though, by this book's shorter length. The narrative doesn't do much to flesh out the developing story and too much of it remains bare-boned to the point of emaciation. The pacing is disjointed, coming in forced fits and starts, not always clearly defined and suffering from several awkward transitions. Creating the world for the series, then stuffing a satisfying romance and a dangerous family threat together is a good idea in theory, but that's a lot of story and there just wasn't room to tell it all fully - to the detriment of the whole thing. Bell has the skill to tell a fully developed story that satisfies on all levels. She's done it before. Had she taken another 100 or so pages to fill out this story, she could have done so here.Unfortunately, as it stands, the romantic couple comes together far too quickly for my personal tastes, Ruby accepts her new world and gets over a lifetime of insecurities far too quickly for my tastes, and the kidnapping plot thread starts, and ends, with far too little development and depth. What's most disappointing is that with the appeal of the characters, I wanted much more of them and was doubly disappointed for not getting it.And then there's the sex.I vacillated on how to classify the genre of this book. Technically, there's too much plot and story development for me to consider it erotica in the manner in which I normally make that determination. There are also, however, sex scenes far too graphic and unconventional to fit into a mainstream paranormal romance - or even an edgy paranormal romance. I don't mind that - I like erotica. The problem is, though, that in this book there is a sex scene that is so egregiously out of place and disparate from the tone of the romantic relationship, the character development, and the plot at the point it was introduced, that I found it jarring and distasteful when read in context.~* WARNING! THERE BE SPOILERS AHEAD!! *~Consider the following: Ruby is very, very shy and sexually inexperienced. Leo has convinced her to go with him across the country because his brother has been kidnapped and he needs to be with his family. He's desperate for her as his mate but desperate to help his brother. He's nervous about telling Ruby he's not human and knows he still needs to do that. Ruby gets to his parent's house and not only is completely overwhelmed by the choices she made to get her to that point, but nearly has a fit when his parents put her in the same room with Leo. She's accosted by the family who kidnapped his brother and Leo bonds with her. The bonding knocks her out for two days and Leo is terrified for her. When she finally wakes up Leo is so relieved that he...grabs the small, sex toy-filled suitcase he brought with him (packing sex toys is, of course, the first thing I think about when I learn my brother has been kidnapped and know it's because of me), unpacks an alarming number of them, blindfolds and handcuffs Ruby to the bed, uses a feather duster, rabbit ear vibrator, and anal plug on her, then proceeds to introduce her to...enthusiastic anal sex in concert with the other toys.Um...yeah...that didn't really work for me. On any level. At all.Had it been a different couple, in a different scenario, at a different time, with a different story going on around them, it would have been a sexy good time had by all. Bell writes sizzling fun sex scenes. There were just way too many things that made that scene inappropriate for this book. When I combine that with the anemic plot development and disjointed pacing of the narrative, the potential of the book went unrealized and I ended up not caring for it. I liked the characters very much...but unfortunately it wasn't quite enough.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","10 28, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",1288224000

THIS SERIES CONTAINS REFERENCE TO, AND IN THE FINAL BOOK, AN ENTIRE STORY REVOLVING AROUND INCEST.This first book in the series is just basically an introduction to the series, and contained no reference to incest, but the second book did. I bought the other three books in the series based solely on this book, because I liked Sonny and Garron and wanted to find out how their story progressed. References to the incestuous relationship between Sonny's identical twin brothers starts in the second book, and through character thoughts and conversations, the author makes it clear that the relationship is long-term (going back to childhood), consensual, and accepted without a murmur by the rest of the family and apparently the entire town. I found this beyond disturbing, and promptly returned the entire series for a refund.After returning them, I went back and read the book descriptions more thoroughly, but beyond a vaguely worded comment in the description of the fourth book, none of them carry any kind of warning that these books contain sensitive or disturbing material. I did find references when I read all the reviews of the fourth book, but it should not be up to the readers to warn others about things like this.

She has become close to Ethan over the last few months.

5663,B001J6OUZA,"[1, 1]","3.5 Stars3/5 Hotness RatingKallysten has created a truly unique universe for her stories and this is only the second of her books that I've read that has been set in The Demons Age. I think that the setting and storyline for this time period is very exciting and adds a unique twist to an already fascinating world.Marc is a vampire that believes in the long ago made Pacts with the humans. He and his Childe, Blake, fight the demons but Blake does it because he thinks it's fun more than anything else. One night while they were fighting they came across a group of human fighters and decided to join forces with them. Among them was a soldier named Kate to whom both found themselves attracted. I guess it was game on between those two from then on. There's nothing like a little rivalry when vying for a woman's attention.The relationship between Marc and Blake is something new to me. I've read a decent amount of Kallysten's creations and I've never come across a Sire/Childe relationship quite like their's before. The parent/child feel isn't there. Marc doesn't force Blake to obey in any way. In fact, Blake's a total pain in the ass. He's always trying to push Marc's buttons and he's awfully immature despite his many decades of life.The three main characters in this book were written extremely well. To put it simply, the were brought to life for me through Kallysten's words. It was like I was watching the story play out before my eyes. I was able to feel Kate's confusion over her conflicting emotions for the two vampires. I disliked Blake's childlike behavior towards Marc. When Marc felt exasperated by Blake's antics I was right there with him and I can easily envision myself smacking Blake upside the head. I love it when a read feels real like that.Since this is only the first in a trilogy about the same set of lovers, a lot of the book was built on the character building. As you can tell, I think Kallysten did a fabulous job with it. I missed the smoldering love scenes though. The scene between Marc and Blake was brief and the other scene in the story was only a murky dream. I look forward to reading the next book and getting deeper into the attraction between the three.","04 21, 2012",A3N7QZ5S5FQ4CN,Meggerfly,1334966400

I really liked how the two guys interacted. It wasn't a case of one of them being more dominant and leading the relationship or Charlie riding in to rescue Booker. The power kind of moved back and forth to who was in control which I liked.

He takes double doses of his medicine and other drugs to feel better.  Much of the time he is incompetent because he is in a haze.  You'd think that since he's been seeing ghosts for most of his life, he'd be used to it and have ways to deal with it.  But no, he's freaking out all the time trying to run away from every ghost he sees.  The reason he's a psycop is because he can talk to ghosts.  I was disappointed that he didn't use that skill in either of the first two books.  But to be fair he does talk to one or two ghosts briefly in each book - but not related to solving a case.Second, in addition to running away from ghosts, he runs away from people - his friends, his acquaintances, his lover.  He buys crystals to help him with a problem, but then he runs away from the guy without knowing how to use them.  Later he must return to the guy to ask how to use the crystals.  A ghost tells him how (which may or may not be true), so Vic runs away from the guy again without getting instructions.  When others ask Vic how things are, he lies and says fine so they will go away and leave him alone.  This did not interest me.  It frustrated me.  Experts say ""don't write about wimps.""  I agree.  Vic is a wimp.Vic leaves his phone turned off, so when friends try to reach him, they can't.  He intends to tell Jacob (his lover) about a problem, but he wimps out and doesn't tell him.  When Jacob starts to talk about something, Vic says ""Do we have to talk about it right this second?""  Again, running away.Later when some bad guys are caught and the cops are asking Vic for details, Vic doesn't tell them that the bad guys have other safe houses.  I did not like his reason.  Some might say the reason was stupid.  Others might say he had a believable motive for keeping the secret, but he didn't act on it.  So his lying to the cops was for nothing.I really liked the relationship with Jacob.  It's hot.  Jacob is so intense and into Vic.  It's too bad the surrounding story was weak.DATA:Narrative mode: first person Vic.  Kindle count story length: 2078 (314 KB).  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.

Darlyle one day suddenly informs her elder sister Diona, that she is going to marry Alexis, the brother of a rich business tycoon Nikias Dranias, and elopes to Greece. Diona sensing trouble immediately shoots off to Greece to save her sister from a disaster. But she gets kidnapped by Nikias and held hostage in his private island, having been mistaken as Darlyle. Her stay in the luxurious island and repeated vigorous sexual encounters with the rich, handsome and sexy Nikias brings her intimacy and ultimately she falls in love with him. Nikias, though initially mistakes her to be a schemer and master sketcher to claim some ransom from him on behalf of her sister, later realizes that Diona came to Greece just to take her sister away from his brother Alexis, and he wrongly kidnapped her instead. Meanwhile Alexis and Darlyle get married and live happily. The true love of Diona is reciprocated by Nikias by not only confessing his love to her but also with an offer to marry her; just at the time when Diona decides to leave Nikias forever, instead of just being his bed partner.Positives: A beautiful soft story to reveal how love between two strangers can be born so suddenly, out of nowhere. Also to elicit that sometimes lust and physical attachment gives way to long lasting love and undoubtedly becomes the binding factor for two people to stay together forever. Very plain and smooth ride through the book. Good enough for a weekend time pass. Love rides though wealth gallops.Negatives: Except for the mistaken kidnap and violent sexual encounters between Nikias and Diona, there are not much twists and turns in the story. Very few rich guys out there nowadays who do not mix love and lust together. Does physical intimacy between a male and female enhance true love? Or does it bring it down?My rating is 3 out of 5","01 27, 2014",A2LNVIYOP4RTO5,Kiran KK,1390780800

Normally, I'm not a great fan of the ""tell"" style of writing, but as this story is actually portraying one side of a conversation, it's entirely appropriate.This story does, indeed, chronicle the lifespan of the narrator's breasts, from their sudden emergence to their ""betrayal"". There's a good dose of humour, both black and blue, and I found the emotional content appropriate and touching. The breasts themselves act almost as a character, and the narrator allows them to be both a physical and emotional barrier whenever she feels overwhelmed. The loss of such a big part (literally and metaphorically) of her lifestyle is handled with a cracked bravado that Ms. Brio conveys very well.This story is probably not for everyone, of course.

10414,B002FK3U0A,"[2, 2]","I'm conflicted about this book.  Don't misunderstand me about the surprise on reviews, I do like the book.  However, the continuity and details made it very hard for me to give this a good rating.  Fey have long life expectancy from what the first book states.  Sorry for the spoiler, but I'm stating this because it IS in the first book.  Betina is proof of that.  Although, I think because she is High Priestess and Fey, it makes her life expectancy a tad longer.  But Duncan is also half Fey, and he has a long life too.  Then there is the fact of what Megan is.  I won't spoil it, but the fact it is stated she is mortal: makes no sense!  She should be just as supernatural as the next.  She is what she is: mixed, but that doesn't make her any less supernatural.Aside from that, I sort of like Dante. I was more into Duncan in this one.  From what I could tell his character takes the magic aspect like Allie and Betina did.  My other issue is Duncan not using flashing them to safety.  Uh, what happened to that ability?  Did he lose that yet still conjures up glowing swords?  And the bit about using something as means to get rid of poison?  Why is it in the first book, this was not used?  Silver is just as much a poison to vampires and weres and there was no need for what Duncan says helps rid poison from their body.  It was inconsistent to the first book.  Or maybe just an excuse to have multiple partners, but still make this a book on a couple.  I'm going to say yes it was used just for that.  Which is just plain horrible to use Duncan in this sense.  He was imprisoned and released in the previous book by Allie...yet he is used in this one.  Kinda horrible that he couldn't find happiness in this book especially considering a detail that is found out about a character.  I just think he got short changed BIG TIME.  Then again he deserves better.Megan.  What to say about her.  I liked her, but I didn't love her like I adored Allie.  She is constantly back and forth with feelings.  Let me emphasize.  She makes it very clear she feels something for Dante at some point.  Won't say when.  But right away you can tell B. D'arc is making this only about two of the characters and not a trio.  However, she does throw in the sharing aspect quite a bit.  At which point pisses me off at times.  Inner voices are basically laying down just who that couple should be.  Yet, you wonder about the one character who saves them continuously.  I just don't understand why this couldn't have included Duncan also. Given how close Dante and Duncan are. And don't get me wrong I get being a good friend, but that?  Yeah, that was taking the friendship to an entirely different level.  Sure they were mature about it, but it squeaked me out more than the twin brothers in the first book. I got that, and even excepted it.  This? I don't know, unless at some point she plans to make books about what Duncan's character actually is.  It's stated in the first book that he is a Knight and half Fey.  So maybe a bunch of Knights and half Fey or Knights and Fey get there own set of books aside from this series?  Because it seems to me we won't see Duncan getting his own book anytime soon.  So yeah, he was written in a way that he was used big time.  Aggravated me.  Probably why it's taking me so long to read this.  It's losing my interest.  And probably because I saw better chemistry when all three were together, but hey, just my opinion, I guess.I didn't find this book as hot as the first and I'm not a big fan of twins with the same woman.But I'm not finished and pushing through this book even though I'm not as immersed as I was with the first.  So I will update.Update:The inconsistencies are a big problem for me.  Another is the very fact she discusses not using the backdoor during sex...yet she has done this.  It's like the act is happening for the very first time at every sexual interaction they have.  It's highly annoying.  I'm surprised no one noticed this at all.  Another spoiler from the last book.  Don't read this unless you've read the first.  But my issue is that there is so much emphasis on the fact Dante got rid of a character that is of importance to a family in this one, yet he aided.  It was Allie the Priestess who banished that character whom Dante is being blamed for.  That was a very big pet peeve how that wasn't argued with the bad villains of the story.  They knew what Patrick was up to, yet they don't follow through and assume it's Dante?  Dante helped, along with Duncan, but it was ultimately Allie who banished this Patrick.  This character is the reason behind a revenge vendetta against Dante.  I understand why they think it's him...BUT they are so wrong.  And why when it does get pointed out it wasn't him, it's brushed off.  I get the reasons for going after Dante, because I won't say that spoiler, but seriously they needed to go to the source too.  (maybe this will come up in later books, I hope?)Too many things just weren't consistent with the truth of the first book.  I had a very hard time with a certain joining too.  There was nothing spectacular about it.  Just words spoken of We are one.  Yet, Dante shares a bond with Tim from the first book and even more so with Duncan from the first book and even this book.  I'm going to spoil this right now so read at your own discretion: But given there was sex between Duncan, Megan, and Dante at one point.  To control Dante's urge to feed he bit Duncan.  Um, I've read quite a few vampire bonding books, but this was very very weak.  It would mean that Dante bonded with anyone he slept with.  This one business was, too me, a cop out.  Automatically joining them.  I didn't find it romantic at all.  I found it too convenient so that it was just the two.  As I'm sure it was intended to begin with.  I really wished I did find it romantic and a great joining, but I didn't.  But this book wasn't anywhere in the same caliber as the first of this series.  That joining between Tim/Allie/Rafe was believable.  I kinda want to grab Duncan out of this book and give him something 100 times better than these two.  D'arc definitely throws him to the side, but loves to tell you the reader that he's okay with it.  I wouldn't have been.  I still have an issue that she changed how magic users rid poison.  It just didn't fit.  I still believe it was to add the spice of multiple partners.  Because come on!  How the heck can a poisoned nearly dying vamp manage to have sex????  Yeah I'm not going to totally spill on that scene, but seriously?  It makes you wonder how this technique of ridding poison wasn't used in Lord's of the Were when Duncan shows up.  I'm just stumped how details can change so quickly from each book.  Yes, I'm into details and certain details done jive with the first book.Final Update:I'm hoping this isn't the case with the rest of the Were series because I totally loved the first book!  And now finishing this story...finally, I'm still very much conflicted.  A lot didn't add up to the previous book.  I wonder how the ending will come about if we don't see much of a certain character being tagged by a certain familiar.  The joining between these two Dante and Megan, was kinda cheesy and way too romanticized to be believable at times.  And I'm still smarting about the fact that she needs to be something else.  She is part something, part were, and part human.  She should have long life expectancy, yet I think we are to assume she doesn't, which negates what we read in the first book.  I just don't get that.  Some things with these details just boggled my mind.  I'm sorry I tried to like this story.  A lot of it was telling with some bits of it showing then right back to telling. I don't know some things were contradicting the first story and then this one takes on a new leaf, so to speak.  I get making two characters the be all, but it was overly done. Kinda like without you, we are so dead, it's up to these two. Yet, when it was done for the Lords of the Were, it was tastefully done.  It worked. For these two it was pushed and pushed.  You find yourself really pulling for another trio to come together, but it's NOT going to happen.  Yet, he does MORE heroic and amazing things during this entire book, and he amazed me the most aside from some special characters that came on the scene!  I was not connecting well with Megan or Dante in this story.  I swear even with the first part of the book, I wanted Duncan to find his happiness.  And, at this point, I don't think we will see it any time soon.  Unless of course it's thrown in there in later stories just to conclude his part in all of this.  Rather sad, because I connected so much to him in the first book and this book.No doubt most won't agree with me, but the details killed me.  Given the fact that I'm into details, this was disappointing because I do like Bianca's work.  I hope to enjoy the rest of the series.  I recommend read if you aren't a detail wolf like me (lol), but I am not like the others with their praise for this book.  I failed to review the last book, because I wanted to read this one.  And I don't review every book either.  This one I had to say something.  I was really into Dante in the first book.  This one he literally died in my eyes.  No connection. So yeah, disappointment.  I hope Rocky is better!","04 29, 2013",A2TJTW4YVA3ZHO,"mmmo19 ""Lissa""",1367193600

7666,B0016IXMCI,"[3, 3]","From what I understand, this is Mari Carr's first published piece and frankly, it kind of reads that way. I liked the two main characters and enjoyed their connection, plus there were some places with decent chemistry and sizzle. Overall though, it all felt very inconsistent. At some points Ross seems very alpha, at others we're told he's alpha but really see no evidence of that.The beginning of their sexual relationship felt a little awkward, with them running hot and cold and bouncing around back and forth on what they understand their relationship to be. The whole thing felt choppy, the love scenes short, jumping from one to another, then skipping a few days, etc. There were only a few lines in each scene that started to make me feel hot and bothered, and then it would sizzle away. It sometimes seemed like the ingredients were there, but for some reason they didn't come together as they should and it ended up feeling ... flat.One *HUGE* complaint I have: They start off almost at the beginning with role-playing - and role-playing in which Julia is a captive or sex slave, i.e. she's supposed to be somewhat resisting. While resistance is not a big part of the role-playing, it's still present, so I found it extremely disturbing that there was no safe word and they didn't lay down any rules or understandings beforehand.As I said before, I liked Julia and Ross and really enjoyed their friendship and the dialogue back-and-forth between them. I think the story could have turned out far better if that part had been more heavily explored and the sexual component of their relationship slowly integrated in. A really fantastic example of this that I read recently was Claire Matthews'Intimate Friends. That novella is even shorter, so the length constraint is greater and they start sleeping together pretty early on, however it felt much smoother and worked far better than in this case.ROMANCE NOVELLA RECOMMENDATIONS:*Intimate Friendsby Claire Matthews (4.5 stars)*Hearts In Darknessby Laura Kaye (4.5 stars)*Willing Victimby Cara McKenna (4 stars)","08 19, 2011",A2AEGAEODIRX75,J.

10825,B00311JTYS,"[0, 0]","This was a pretty good book by Evangeline Anderson. This book had BDSM elements, which I don't usually read or get into, but it wasn't too heavy for jarring which I appreciated.The premise of the story is of two sisters who are a year and a few weeks apart, but who are complete contrasts of one another. Sabrina Markes is the younger of the two, svelte in size, and is one who takes full advantage by her show of immaturity and lack of common sense or awareness of others. Jillian is the older sister who has always had to watch out for her sister and bail her out of trouble countless times throughout her sister's life. She is also plus size (a size eighteen) and is very insecure about her size, especially when she has a size 2/3 sister to constantly compare herself two.An interesting parallel in this book is that we are dealing with two sets of siblings. Adam, who happens to be the owner of We Kidnap U - a business that provides a service to fulfill any woman's fantasy, is the younger brother of Kyle, who is a carpenter. Sabrina ends up buying into her fantasy which would be fulfilled by Adam, but he ends up needing to leave town for a convention and forces his brother to cover this one job. Kyle begrudgingly agrees to cover this one job and ""kidnap"" Sabrina and fulfill her fantasy. However, flakey as she ever is Sabrina changes her mind and sails out of town herself with her man of the moment, and tells her sister Jillian that she would cancel her kidnapping. But that does not end up happening.Kyle ends up kidnapping Jillian, for he believes her to be the client Sabrina but is pleasantly surprised not only by her beauty but of her curvaceous size, which turns him on. He them goes on to submit Jillian to Sabrina's elaborate fantasy.This wasn't a long read, but I liked how we got to see the inner dialogues of both main characters. It was heavily on Jillian's thoughts and from her perspective, but I appreciated the back and forth. I also thought that she was fast to submit, but since that was a desire of hers I guess that makes sense.

If this is a self-published work then it's on a par if not better than most of the mass market romance novels out there.The authour took great care to create these two intriguing characters. Jarath is believable, likeable, and not too perfect like most romance book heroes (he drinks too much) thanks to being married to a scheming witch for the so long.I loved the way Brianna jumped into Alexandra's life through the clouds, and straight into giving birth.

I'm sure there was a reason wny this was never mentioned, other than she didn't lead a very interesting life, but what kind of job she had or a bit about any family she might have left behind might have been interesting.Even though it's been a while now since I actaully read it, I am recalling a great deal, and another good thing about this book was that it didn't get bogged down with pages and pages of sex secenes like so many of the current roamnces seem to, which meant the authour wanted to tell the story about this relationship's developement, rather than take the easy way out by describing erotic sex scenes.","03 18, 2010",A2HX87JHRE6IOB,"meloco ""meloco""",1268870400

After they interview several horrid candidates they open the door to a young woman who'd fallen off her bicycle before showing up for her interview. Just one look at her and both men fall for the innocent girl and are determined to make her theirs.  Soon, Susie's cooked and cleaned her way into their hearts and what starts as merely some sensual fun turns into a desire for something much more.Susie's Choice was an interesting read. One thing's for sure, it was definitely a scorching hot read. But I just couldn't bring myself to like any of the characters. Susie's father treated her deplorably and she really didn't say anything in her defense. Even her brothers took her for granted, all demanding she cook and clean for them, having no life of her own.Christian's constant telling Joel he loved him, with no response in return was disheartening and almost seemed desperate. Joel's cowardice in not telling Christian he loved him went beyond his fear of being hurt. It smacked almost of manipulation, which lowered his stature in my eyes.While the sex between the two men as well as the three of them was undeniably hot, it seemed there were more pages of sex than there were of plot.  It got to the point that I really felt I knew nothing about the characters and wasn't sure if I wanted to. If you're interested in a story filled with almost nothing but sex and a token Happily Ever After, Susie's Choice might be something you'd be interested in reading. If, however, you want a story with any sort of character development and emotional depth, you might want to give this one a pass.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews.","02 2, 2012",ATNPFCCWHQWJJ,"Bella March ""Bookaholic, Book Reviewer""",1328140800

And I'm sorry to say that because I was pretty excited to get into this book at the very beginning.The world building was very basic and very poorly done. Like an outline, with no substance. There wasn't a lot of background about the witch, who she was, why she did what she did. No motive, no nothing. Just a bunch of sex, which was pretty good and half way decent, until I realized that was all there was going to be.I found myself wanting the book to end, which is really sad being that it was only about seventy pages long. The dialogue was really bad and so borderline cheesy that I found myself rolling my eyes near the end.And don't even get me started on the character development.

6072,B001RV3ON6,"[0, 0]","First off the book is rather well written.  At times (mostly the action scenes (all 2 of them)) it was a little hard to follow, but it was a rather simplistic read.  My issue with the book is the pretense of involving ""werewolves"" at all.  It is really just a book about two people and love.  That's fine and all, but don't try to add an element of fantasy that is simply not there in this book.  It might come later in the series, but I will not read on to find out.  I read the entire book to never actually have a werewolf involved in it but in name alone.I was sorely disappointed with the story-line as a romantic novel, with little to no action.  Had I ordered the book from amazon, and not simply on my kindle, I imagine the cover would have tipped me off, so shame on me. 1 star for being rather well written, 1 star for what I guess might be an engaging romantic novel, but I cannot verify that as its not my genre.  I don't trash novels often, hence the 3 stars, but the book simply was not what the profile made it seem (at least while reading the bio on my kindle).","08 15, 2011",AZJSS1DPDTZ2P,"Dantes ""Dantes""",1313366400

As in, shoot them and hang their heads on your walls. Sydney's problem is she a) doesn't want to hunt and b) has erotic dreams of a hunky shifter. When the embodiment of her dreams, Jason, saves her from being eaten by a vicious treadmill, her life (and his!) is never going to be the same.Comments:- Quite a long book (5074 kindle locations).- Bedroom scenes are spicy rather than erotic (not particularly frequent), all m/f with constant references to gay friend and cross-dressing.- It is a different/original take on the human/Shifter relationship (redneck hunters vs suited Shifters), with lots of story and plot.- When I picked up this book, it was on some sort of promotion and thus $0. It isn't now. However, as stated by another reviewer, the cost of the book doesn't really affect my view of the book. Either it's good or it isn't. And because cost fluctuates, it is unfair to judge it based on price.Opinion:This book is quite funny, and enjoyable, however I didn't like it enough to search out Book 2. The characters are strong and interesting enough but the book could have been half the size and still covered the same material. There isn't anything particularly wrong with this book, it does okay for a light Shifter book.

7288,B001QOGLOS,"[0, 0]","This review is for the Kindle edition ebook.Disclosure:  I was asked to do a review of this book by the author.A good story about wizards and dragons for all ages.A 14-year-old girl is trying hard to believe what her father has told her about Kimyra. When a creature she has never seen shows up, she lies so that she can have her own adventure. This is the second book of the trilogy.The heroine is a strong-willed girl, who has decided to have her own adventure. This story is exciting, fast-paced, and might have you holding your breath while some of the action takes place. It has all the elements of the first story, but the heroine has much more self-confidence. The description of the shadow world of Kimyra was excellent. I was not ready for the story to end when it did.Rick Just writes because stories are in his head, and need to come out. Good books aimed at teens and young adults can be hard to come by. This story shows the young reader that persistence can overcome the challenges in our lives, even when those challenges seem to be overpowering.I would recommend this story to teens and young adults. It is a very well written, fun to read book. If you have not readWizard Chase (The Wizards Trilogy Book 1)by this author, I would recommend reading it first, it will help you to understand the context better. This is the second book of the series. I have grabbed the next book of this series, I need to find out what happened to Kat.","06 4, 2014",A22X8SXCBIY746,Charles J. Kravetz,1401840000
5436,B0044XV846,"[74, 76]","I hate, I mean absolutely hate to give this two stars. But I just can't give it more stars because I would want the same warning before I buy an awful book. I can't remember how much I paid for this, but even 99 cents is too much. Honestly I want to give it one star, but I'm trying to find the good in it.Before I list pros and cons, I must mention that this is a Christian book. But other than a few prayers and mentioning once that they were in church, it's not drenched in it. There's no preaching, and in fact I wouldn't think a non-Christian would have a problem with this book (other than the negatives I list below...) But on that same note- if you're looking for something kinda conservative or like Jenny B Jones (whom I would highly recommend) - this is not really it. It's kind of watered down Christianity. And I'm not saying that's bad- that may make you want to buy this book more. :)The positives: There's a good story in here. Many girls have done what the lead character, Kate,  does.... gives her heart to a boy who doesn't return the same feelings. And there's another love story that ends in a guy that's just ""Not that into her."" So many readers should be able to relate to one of her stories.There are even a couple funny lines in there where i laughed out a little bit.Kate had some witty lines and has a pretty strong character to her.And, aside from what I will write as my 1st point in the negatives list, the story does get better. The 2nd half almost (but not quite) redeems the first part.The negatives: I truly hate to say this but that may be one of the worst written books I've ever read. Oh how badly I wanted to stop reading after chapter 1.It would have stuff like: "" 'I'm so mad' said Kate angrily.""  Every single time someone spoke it had a ""Said so and so"" after it. There's an art to writing and that ain't it. ;-)I'm wondering if this is the author's first book. And I'm guessing it didn't have an editor.***************BIG FAT SPOILER*************I did not like that ending!!! Are you kidding me? We get to know two other guys that she falls in love with but not the guy she actually marries???????????? They say like 7 sentences to each other and then get married?????? I hate that the author left this stuff out. This is what we want to read. We want to see the dialog between them so we can see they belong together. There wasn't enough there for me to feel as though Kate had feelings for him, or knew anything about him other than his one tragic loss.It was the most important relationship in the entire book, summed up in about 6 pages, and left me disappointed and wanted more . Not more of their lives to follow, but more of the meat of their relationship to help me realize they were good together.

This isn't unusual. I'm a writer and a voracious reader. If you can trick me and have the proper groundwork in place to back up your twist, I'm impressed.For me, the allegory is too plain here. It isn't preachy yet, but I suspect it might become that way before the series is finished. Of course, this makes me want to check out the next book to see if I'm right.While this first installment in the series does seem to have a story problem that is resolved (find the wielder) it isn't the main character's problem. His problem is feeling like an outcast in his home reality and I guess that is resolved in the story. It seems pretty easily resolved to me. The plot is strong for the story but the character arc is weak.If you like quests, magic, elves, dragons and battle scenes, you will probably enjoy this book.

8356,B0028TXRJW,"[5, 7]","Stacy Daniels's father has been dead to her for years but now that he's finally passed away in reality she has some very difficult decisions to make.  She's been living and working in Great Falls but her father's ranch is where her heart truly lies.  There's just the little issue of her love for Wolfe, Cash and Travis and how wrong loving them seems.Brothers Wolfe, Cash and Travis have been in love with Stacy for years.  They've done their best to protect her from her father's bullying and hateful attitude.  They've never expressed their feelings to Stacy and now with her father gone they feel it's time for her to come back to the ranch - where she belongs - as their woman.Stacy's guilt over the perceived wrong on being in love with three men is emotionally agonizing.  She's convinced her only option is to sell the beloved ranch and return to Great Falls as soon as possible.  Only first she has to consult the attorney about the property and for some reason the man is never available.  That means she spends a lot of time around the ranch and avoiding Wolfe, Cash and Travis is impossible especially when each of them keeps such a close eye on her.  When each man individually seduces her she becomes even more confused and scared.  Despite the men's insistence that she is home, she's determined to leave and doesn't believe there's any way she can confide in them about her feelings for them all.  As it is she's afraid they're going to find out that's she's cheated on each of them with their own brother.  Only there are things that Stacy doesn't know which will shock and change everything she's ever believed.  Will she stay after learning the truth about the ranch and what her father did?HER DAKOTA MEN takes readers on an emotional journey along with the characters as each comes to grips with their feelings and what they mean for their future.  Stacy's generous nature and love for the ranch and everyone who resides there really touches your heart even as you wonder how she could be such a sweet person when her father was so mentally abusive.  Wolfe, Cash and Travis are wonderful men who want nothing more than Stacy's happiness - and for her to stay at the ranch.  They're all dominant men by nature and their interactions with Stacy are beyond scorching.

And the crying shame is that this author assembled all the ingredients that really do it for me in M/M romance, that I so rarely find, but either lacked the skill to make them resonate or, more likely, was already plotting the next book in the series as she colored in the lines for this one. Don't mean to be harsh but I was quite disappointed.I LOVE opposites. I LOVE flamboyant, flirty fellows with a camp sensibility being  adored and desired by macho men. Femmey boys and the men they swoon for. Not everyone's cuppa but such pairings are not at all uncommon among gay men and deserve their place in a homogenized sea of musclebound cowboys, closeted Mafiosi and hard boiled detectives. Give me an Edward and Jack anytime. Vive la difference because it's hot! But give me a story worthy of their sizzling chemistry. Don't tell me how they feel. Make me feel it! So much rich back story to explore! So many motivations to untangle. But nope. Everything is very quick and, snip snip, Jack's twenty year, tightly controlled, closet fortress crumbles in less than a week. I do believe in love in first sight but not instant commitment for ever and ever. To come to that realization takes time and that's just what the author seemed incapable of giving the reader.Okay, this book wasn't so terribly bad as these things go but it was too formulaic. The female author doesn't have quite a realistic grasp of the 45 year old male refractory period. Immediate, constant, &#34;bone hard&#34; erections after six months? Give me what he's having! The last third was sticky sweet and not only were they in love and committed in six days, Edward had aquired a whole new set of devoted pals and cohorts willing to rally and support him in the same six days. The Meemaw story was touching and made me cry but I sniffle at laundry commercials so take that as you will.I so wanted to love this book. And I just. Didn't. Not enough anyway. Winston the little bulldog was cute with personality to spare. Would that the author had painted a Jack and Edward's romance with such a deft hand.But, contrarian that I am, I do plan to buy at least one of the other stories in the series. The Sammi/Mitchell one. Again, because fey boys being delightfully and willingly manhandled by big, silent types totally does it for me. Until a nice thick steak of a story with that dynamic comes along I guess I'll continue to feed my kink with cotton candy. So I score four for the characters and Winston the dog.

11966,B0017HNV1U,"[0, 0]","The Code of Hammurabi, from the third millenium B.C.E., was an attempt to encode various laws into a fairly straight forward justice system. Numerous specific crimes are mentioned, along with very specific punishments. Most of the crimes revolve around things dealing with farming, buying and selling things, and debts.Punishments ranged from paying a fine (in money or goods/animals), to somewhat much more severe, like having a hand cut off, all the way to death. Some of the things I found most interesting are as follows:Threaten a witness? You die.Judge makes a mistake in giving the penality? Out of a job.Steal. Depends who you steal from. If you're rich, you pay 30 times the amount stolen; if poor, you pay ten times the amount stolen. The laws seemed to be fairly balanced in this way, the penalty in money or goods higher for the rich person than for a poor person.If a woman opens a wine house? She dies.If a wife has sex with some other guy and is caught, they are tied together and drowned.If a wife is very ill, the guy can take another wife but must still take care of the first one.If a son has sex with his mother and they are caught, both are burnred to death.If a son strikes a father, one of his hands is cut off.If a guy causes another guy to lose an eye or break a limb, the same will be done to him.If a guy hits a pregnant woman and she dies, thus losing the baby, then, if the guy has a daughter, she dies.There's also a whole section on the fees various people can charge, including doctors, vets, house builders and ship builders.All-in-all a very harsh system of laws, but in some ways, especially the rich paying a much stiffer penalty than the poor, most fair than today's laws.","08 2, 2013",A1NDYD4JKKY9LE,"Sarah Marie ""sarah_marie""",1375401600

3754,B002TG4O50,"[0, 0]","4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this collection of short stories. They are all set in Parmas, a city where powerful sorcerers use spells and demons' parts to enhance technology or produce consumer goods. They live side by side with humans. We gather that sorcerers used to rule Parmas with an iron fist, but they had to restrain their powers and be more magnanimous to humans and demons alike. The Hell Cops - a law enforcement unity which apprehends loose demons or rogue sorcerers - help maintain the peace and order in the city. The three stories all takes place here, but the three different authors tell the story of one particular couple. I liked them all for different reasons.Next of Kin by Astrid Amara.Jay Yervant is a hell cop who comes from one of the richest families in Parmas. He is a loner because he is a sort of freak of nature even in a city like Parmas: he can't touch anybody because he literally burns. He doesn't fit in his family and he doesn't really fit in the police force either, because he could kill or maim people with a simple touch. One night he meets Brian Day, a young man working in a hospital, who casually touches him without being affected by Jay's condition. Brian is a special man: he is in Parmas looking for the father he's never known. He is young, handsome, naive. Jay is drawn to him for these reasons and because Brian seems to be involved in his investigation, but especially because he craves someone's touch.I think this story was the more complete in terms of world building and the most satisfying in terms of plot. I liked seeing how the younger and more naive character was also the sex expert, while the big tough cop was the more inexperienced. I wish this aspect of their interaction had been given more space.Red Sands by Nicole Kimberling.Michael Gold is a half demon working as a Professor. While returning from a trip between worlds, he ends up together with the corpse of a man. Initially Michael seems the killer and Argent is the hell cop who apprehends him. It doesn't take much to learn that the two of them have history and to clear Michael of all accusations, but still it seems someone near Michael must be the killer and the two investigate together.I liked very much Michael and it probably was so much more interesting than Argent that I didn't feel the connection between the two protagonists. I also think that the ending felt a bit rushed. The most interesting aspect was Michael's halfling nature that prevents him to fit completely in Parmas' world, since there is a sort of prejudice against demons. Argent and Michael should be enemies, but the attraction is too strong. I wish there had been more pages to develop this part of the story.Touching Sparks by Ginn Hale.James and Moran are my favorite couple. Moran, the hell cop, has known James since when he was a child, but little James, a photographer, now is all grown up and is helping Moran with an investigation. James has been attracted to Moran since forever, but he doesn't know how to approach the older and aloof man. Something happened to Moran in the past, we gather that he lost his lover in a traumatic way, and now he seems unable to reach out to someone else. He is attracted to James, he is concerned about his safety, but at the same time he takes no step to learn if James might be interested, he doesn't know if he should act on his attraction.I like stories where there is an age gap and there's the awkwardness of having known someone since when they were children. Moran seems afraid of spoiling James' innocence, as symbolized by his lean and beautiful body which Moran has to heal night after night. There is a very beautiful anticipation, that's why I would have preferred behind-door intimacy.I think all stories had a different degree of sweetness, which I wasn't expecting from these tough guys and in this setting, and they are all beautifully written. The fact that there are three different authors is not disruptive and even if each one of them had a different approach to the world and story, the quality is overall high.","10 9, 2011",A1RXR105ND8OSH,manutwo,1318118400

If my pure love for them wasn't enough, add those scorching sex scenes and you got a banger baby!!I love how this story focused solely on them. With exception for the chapter that gave us a brief view on the Doc, it was all Z and Bella with Nalla. They are the cutest little family, and who would have thought that Z would have been the first to carry on the line of Aghony and the aristocrats? Not me!It was like watching Z and Bella fall in love again. It also gave us an update and dose of reality as to where Z is in his recovery. He's not as far as I suspected at the end of 'Lover Awakened'.  He s struggling and with even more baggage.Even though Mary has paled quite considerably since 'Lover Eternal', the brothers never take a weak female. As such, it's good to see the fruits of Mary's labour and I always love it when she and Z get together. Whether learning or therapy, those two got a rhythm that no one else has with Z, not even Bella. Maybe it's her training, but Mary definitely knows how to handle him.I don't know T.W. and we might never see him again, but I love the man and what he stands for. His moment with his wife was precious, and was a slice of life outside of the supernatural, something that has been missing and slipping as this series grow.An update was also provided on the other members of the brotherhood, however minimal. Phury is back how I remember and respect him, even if he isn't fighting, and it was good to get back out in the field with the brothers. Their tactics and battles always fascinated and intrigued me. I loved 'Dark Lover' where we got more fighting than romance. There was plotting, scheming and failure. I secretly would have liked at least some action from Mr. D, but then again, this novel was about love, reconciling and building new bridges.I searched without seeing a book for Nalla, but I already love the young and anticipate spending time with her uncle Rehvenge in the next novel.

Tension is well built. The impending doom of a battle is clear in the language. The author does a comendable job of creating the rules for the ensuing battle.There is an inflection point where the mages are introduced, the story goes south for a number of paragraphs. The word mage is repeated a lot. The repitition is abrupt compared to the introductory paragraphs where the author chose words very carefully with little repetition. More fantasy words are used and then it becomes clearer, this is real battle combined with a fantasy land battle. Although I hesitate to say fantasy, because this could also be viewed as how Marten copes with the horror around him; although not real, he sees the mages, zombies, and dragons as if they are real.Fortunately the story recovers very nicely and flows into a comprehensible and vivid description of the battle. Once the author settles into the type of phrasing from the early paragraphs, the story regains its power.This is an interesting blending of styles, historical and fantasy.
