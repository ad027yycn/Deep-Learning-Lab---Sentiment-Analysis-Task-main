7272,B004JN0GAI,"[42, 47]",1,"I purchased this story because of the setting.  I usually love Scottish romances and am a fan of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  I figured this would be a short, enjoyable story...and in all truth, it should have been.  It has the makings of a wonderful story, but it seems as if the author got greedy and decided to publish a skeletal outline for a quick sale.  There are too many holes, and it's simply too short to be worth paying for.  For instance, once he realizes ""Reva"" is a girl, he decides to hold her hostage instead of having her executed.  He tells her she has earned her next meal and better lodging, and then in the next sentence, suddenly it's 2 months later and they can't stop thinking of each other.  What?!  She's coming to breakfast, he's staring at her, and they've both fallen in love with each other during those 2 months, even though from what I can tell, they never actually talk to each other?  He still doesn't know who she is, and all she knows of him comes from people who live under his protection.  This is a huge fault, Jackie Barbosa.  You cannot expect the reader to believe they are in love simply because you say they are.  We need to see some sort of progression.  And then to believe that she, a strong woman who would rather face execution and surrender her family name, would blurt out that she's fallen in love with him when  he's her familial enemy?  Ridiculous!  I'm insulted as a reader that I'm expected to just go along with this absurd plot with no attempt to show me how it happened.  With more length and attention to the missing pieces, this could have been a good story.  What a waste!","09 10, 2011",A3NCV7XVGNHRT6,"teacher mom ""teacher mom""",1315612800

10142,B003M5IP2A,"[1, 1]",1,"First of all, I have no problem with menage relationships because one of my all time favorite books is ""Their One and Only"" by Trista Ann Michaels which I loved. Surprisingly, my problem with this book was not the length. However, one of my problems was that I thought that four men having one woman was just overkill. Problem number two being that two of the guys swing both ways but they called themselves family. That was just disgusting!I have no problem with gays, but the fact that one man is being done up his rear by the other while she's performing oral sex on him was just too much for me. That whole visual killed it for me. These are also the same men she heard getting busy up the hall after the first night they all ""shared"" her, so there was no guessing where his junk had been the night before, but she still eagerly put her mouth on him as if it was no big deal...I GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT!If that was not enough, as I previously mentioned, I think four men was way too many for this book. Four people just made the sex scenes more chaotic and scattered to me. It was hard for me to keep up with who was doing what to who, and who was enjoying who, because there was so much going on. Another disappointment, or should I say inconsistency in the story, for me anyway, was after Rayna finally has sex with Jaime for they first time. The two lovebirds actually make a pact that from that point forward he is the only one that will ""get her mouth"" but I guess that only included kissing which I thought was absolutely ludicrous seeing as how later that same day after he has ""claimed her mouth"" the first thing she does is give David, the guy being done by his boyfriend, oral sex. Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that claiming her mouth would include that as well. So, it was perfectly okay to suck them off, just not kiss them, that makes a lot of sense. THINK ABOUT IT AND GET BACK TO ME...You add all that up, and the fact that the whole insta-romance between Jaime and Rayna was just not believable in any way to me just made me not like this book at all, and I really wanted to. I could have cared less about Jaime being scarred and maimed. I just didn't believe there was a real connection happening while she was being banged by three other men. There was literally no time for a real relationship to blossom between those two.I guess I'll just have to count on Ms. Michaels to come save the day again because it seems like she's the only author that gets these menage relationships right on paper.","06 19, 2014",A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,LadyLestat,1403136000

297,B0032C993W,"[2, 3]",1,"I didn't finish this book, and that is incredibly rare for me. Like, I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book.Firstly, as a native Irish speaker, it kind of annoyed me to see Irish words thrown into this book. It just suggested a laziness to me. Using Irish words is fine if there's a reason for it, if your book features Irish legends, or characters, but this book has no ties to Ireland at all, so it was just a convenient way for the author to avoid having to create a language.Anyway, the reasons I didn't finish this;It's incredibly confusing. Most of the time I had no idea what was happening, but that was OK, because very little happened. I gave up a little over a quarter into the book, and the main character had been assigned to work as the doctor on a pleasure ship, had a few run-ins with the staff, and that's it.The main character has no redeeming features at all. She comes across as arrogant, holier-than-thou and self-important. She didn't entice me to keep reading at all.The main male character similarly, is flat and uninteresting. He used to be one of the most elite fighters in the universe, now he serves as the captain of a 'floating brothel' because his mother, the queen, is punishing him for refusing to marry. He is arrogant, rude, and while I'm sure he's stunningly attractive, there is no physical description of him, the ship, the universe. There is no world-building.This book is meant to be erotica, and to be fair, I gave up before there was a real sex scene, but I wasn't holding out much hope that they would be hot, given that two references to a man's penis were made, using the word 'dangly'.

Perhaps if the author had given the romance portion time to develop slowly instead of the ""oops I couldn't control myself"", I might have been able to enjoy the story more.  Unfortunately, the author kept presenting the wife and lover as people of honour and the husband as a monster and while I believe she did the latter she failed miserably in the former. I also felt as if the ending was a cheat, I knew it was coming but I kept hoping that she would be a little more original.

August Heat was the WORST book in the series. There was no menage sex or menage anything in this book.

They are few and far between and hard to find.Since there weren't any reviews I downloaded a sample, it  was lovely, so I bought the book.  It was $5.11 for my Kindle, around average for a FULL LENGTH ebook.  Imagine my suprise when I realized after 20 mins. of reading, I was 60% thru the book!  Nowhere in the book description does it say Novella or Short Story, PLUS the book ends way before 100%(93% approx)they don't give page numbers, sorry non-Kindlers.  That's the only way I can give the book length! So, I paid full book price and got the equivalent of 4-6 chapters.BUT, I think the actual story itself was decent. If it could be expanded upon and made into a full length book, it would be worthy of it's price and I would have given it 4 stars(If it had been a good rewrite of course!)I do think that Amazon should perhaps make it mandatory for authors of books/novellas/short stories under a certain word count to inform their readers of the length of the book.  It's not right to pay for and expect a full length book yet get something entirely different.  EVEN IF the story is cute.  Most of the other stories around this length run from $.99-$1.99.

She can't deny sensing...something. A certain feeling when she, Sean and their friend Chad are all together.  In a house filled with secrets, Chad's are doozies.When an opportunity arises to explore their deep desires, the trio plunges into a sex-filled, emotionally charged m&eacute;nage.

Jumped from secret desires to all out BDSM menage.  Sean was nothing but a bully with control issues and a taste for sadism while Lauren went from a strong and confident woman to sex-slave.

Many paragraphs had two people talking in them so that you were constantly going back and forth between characters, and trying to make sense of it. The second thing was the hero was a jerk. He treated the heroine like crap. All he wanted was to have sex with her, even when he believed she was his brother's girlfriend. And then he did. What kind of brother does that? A big no no for me is also when the hero sleeps with other women,(implied) even if he and the heroine were on a break. Granted, they were on a break for 6 months but if he cared anything about the girl he wouldn't be jumping into someone else's bed.What irritated me about the heroine is she hates him one minute, and sleeps with him the next. She's wishy washy and her character is weak. You didn't get the feel that there was any real warmth, even real lust developing between them. The sex scenes were luke warm but it was more because of the author's choice of words than the actual act.And yet somehow they fall in love and she finally gets that proposal at the end.

11496,B004477ZLW,"[7, 10]",1,"I have read many books with in this genre. They seem to fall into two categories. Either they are well written, well thought out love stories that just happen to have more than one partner in the mix. (Note: Maya Bank's Colters' series.) Or the stories are like this book: The Perfect Union. Too quick with the declaration of love. Too quick agreeing to a relationship like the men were proposing, and too quick with the sex. Even the acceptance from friends and family seemed to be automatic, as if this type of relationship happened every day.It is obvious to me that the writer wanted to get the three together so that their sexual attraction can be written. I am a writer as well, so I believe I understand the motivation. She probably had a series of ideas she wanted to accomplish with the book. But I believe she rushed through them, as if doing so off of a check list. Situations have to be worked through carefully and slowly if they are to be believable.Finding love, especially after the death of someone that meant a lot to a person, isn't easy. Sure, there are those times when the sparks fly, but the widow or widower often feels squeamish about having another relationship. Add children to the mix and, I'm sorry, they don't have sex on the kitchen floor when their children are due home any minute. A mother will do what she can to shield her children and reassure them that they are what is most important to her.The way Rick and Conor are accepted by the children is believable, don't get me wrong. They were in the boys' lives since they were infants. The children never knew their father so having them around was normal to them. But I am only half way through the book, and no where did Calleigh wonder what their father would think bringing someone else (or two someones) into their lives as a father figure.I don't understand Calleigh's spouting of their relationship to strangers either. And the storyline about the coworker who thought he was her boyfriend was so unbelievable, especially since he wasn't mentioned since the only date they had months before.As I said, I have only read half of this book. I haven't gotten to the part where Kevin's parents show up, but I'm sure it will be as the rest of the book is. Contrite and off of the same checklist.The prose is choppy. The conversations are more than choppy. I don't feel that this story is anything more than a poor version of what can be found on one of the erotic story sites. I'm sure that Ms. Lane had good intentions, but I feel that this story could have been so much more if it didn't seem as though it was rushed, and if it had more feelings in it. I guess what I am trying to say is that this story 'tells' us what is happening. We don't 'feel' it. Just because it is written down, doesn't mean that it is so. The reader has to feel the events unfold before she can believe that they are happening.I gave it one star instead of none because the sex scenes were believable, not contrived positions that only the author would see. I felt no passion between the three lovers, no angst, no real love and affection. All I have seen so far is sex.Yes, the sex is good. I will give it that. But please...

If there were not names on chapters to establish POV - the Linda character and the Mike character sound almost identical.A few of Linda's pranks were cute - but not enough fleshing out of characters or development of story arc to make the one or two chuckles worth the time spent reading this.Christine","06 3, 2012",A30YDY4XKVUBUY,Christine Staeven,1338681600

Then I ran into, what I consider to be, a fatal flaw. Mr. Rain did a drastic POV change. As with all his other books, this one started out in first person. Half way through the book he started sections of third person POV in order to follow Faye, the heroine/love interest. Further along he split again to Farid""s POV in order to show the fight between Farid and Kaseem. I'm sorry, but I just felt that this was poor writing practice. There is nothing wrong with changing POV as such, but going from first to third along with that---not good!I also had trouble suspending disbelief on some of the mountaineering in this book. I don't think Mr. Rain knows or cares about such realities as hypothermia. I also found the helicopter sequence unbelievable. A helicopter is much more complicated to fly than a fixed wing.

In fact, what little information the reader is given about her made her very unattractive. She is materialistic, narcissistic and moody for no clear reason. The very first page clumsily recalls how she picks a fight with her husband over absolutely nothing.Sadly, the pitiful introduction to her hair is the entire basis of the book, although the synopsis held so much promise. The husband is just there so the story can have a male counterpart; he is quite insignificant. If he mentions it once, he mentions it a thousand times that he wants to get to know his wife of seven years. What?!?3. Why does this author (for lack of a better word) make them have their only serious conversations right in the middle of the awful sex scenes, not once but several times? Weird.

There is *none* in this book, and given that it's free, I think there should have been an expectation that this would be peoples' introduction to the series.So, anyway, Holly is eight months pregnant, and 'married' to three brothers who won't have sex with her because they're afraid of hurting her, or the baby.Eventually she manages to convince (i.e. corner and threaten with 'the wrath of a hormonal woman') two of the brothers, and have sex with them. Only one of these sex scenes appear in the book, the other fades to black.Eventually, she has the baby and everyone ends up happily ever after. The description of the birth is a little...graphic for my taste. I would much rather have read about that second sex scene than listen to one of the brothers try to make sure Holly had passed the placenta *shudder*What's really irritating, is the extract at the end of this book is intriguing, but because of the lack of characterisation, backstory and world-building (I know it's not fantasy, but there is zero description of Holly's location and surroundings), means I won't read that book.I only finished this book because it was mercifully short, and I would have felt very guilty giving up on a short story.","04 9, 2012",A1OK2B6G8FNYFM,CharlotteSimmons,1333929600

Buster?Seriously does anyone talk like that?There is also the glaring fact that a 21st century woman kept excusing absolutely heinous actions by her new warm and fuzzy slave-trading, child-murdering, woman-raping family because they didn't make her sleep with the other livestock (read: people).As far as I'm concerned, coercing her into having sex before he told her that she wouldn't be allowed to keep her child was just another example of what a great guy Leif was. At every opportunity to believe in her, her ""husband"" failed but in Kat's mind that was all right because, apparently when you've got piercing blue eyes and a six-pack, you can squeeze your wife's face so hard she cries and it's taken as a sign of what a passionate, conflicted, deep man you are. Am I the only one who wondered what happened to the plotline of Kat being erased from existence if her ancestor was killed?

I didn't like the characters and found the background story on the main characters wasn't developed enough for me to care.  I think the author did herself a disservice because this first novel felt very rushed and incomplete.  We were immediately thrown into the action with characters we had not yet had a chance to get to know and care about.  Then again, what was there to like about the ignorant, money-grubbing Daisy, cunning and crafty Aiden or Peter the Lunk Head?  I was appalled when Aiden admired Daisy's intelligence when she was going on about her business plan talking about ""those people"" (Koreans) so ignorantly I actually winced while reading.  She didn't sound smart; she sounded like a bigot and a hick and someone too young and experienced to have a clue about the world outside of Hollow Creek, KY...which I guess is what she was.  Aiden was so outrageously conniving it was almost comical.  All he needed was a long mustache to twist while laughing maniacally over Daisy tied to a railroad track and the image would have been complete.  Peter was such a chest-thumping, keep-the-woman-barefoot-and-pregnant caveman that the moments where he was supposed to be breaking down and showing his softer side almost didn't make sense.  Also, when Daisy's big (and obvious) secret was finally revealed in a dramatic (and predictable) fashion to Peter; I didn't feel sorry for either character.  I was actually very happy that this little bit of drama had finally come to its predictable conclusion.On a side note:  I found it extremely annoying that Daisy and Peter kept referring to Jessiemae but we never met her.  Here was a character that sounded like she might have a little bit of complexity and she never makes an appearance in the story!!Anyway, I downloaded the second novel, Daisy's Choice, right after completing this bit of fluff and it immediately became apparent that the author tried to make up for what was lacking in the first novel by giving more background on these characters.  But at this point, I find these characters so revolting and unendearing that I no longer care to see them get to, what I suspect, is just another predictable happily ever after.  I returned the second novel and am certian I won't ever reread Aiden's Game.  This is not to say that I am finished with this author because I know she can do better than this trio of stereoptyped, two-dimensional characters.","03 6, 2013",A1KYENSZAYYICL,V. Russell,1362528000

Apparently, this means now that she's entered his domain, she's surrendered to whatever he wants, which he tells her is her ""body, mind and spirit.""Moments after he tells her this, she's inexplicably, violently crazed with lust until he satisfies her (quite easily), then as she tries to fight him, he subdues her with sex again, then he builds her up and demands she wears his collar, which she agrees to in a haze of lust.  He ties her up because he knows when the magic wears off, she'll be ticked off and try to leave him before he can do the sex mojo thing on her again.It's all explicit and if you like that kind of thing without it being necessarily erotic or having any emotional element, than you'll enjoy this.  Tessa and Kortal have absolutely no emotional connection; she's his possession from the moment she walks into his office and she's struck deaf and dumb with lust immediately because of some super mind-bending ability of his; when he's not around, she comes to her senses, then loses them again when he returns.This is from Ellora's Cave, and if you're familiar with them, this particular story would fit with their Exotica collection in my opinion (it contains stories that are more unusual, push boundaries and don't necessarily include affection or happily ever afters), although I don't think this writing is up to par with the authors that are generally included in that series.","07 12, 2010",A1TFMR7RE985MF,Countess Chocula,1278892800

Allow me to give you some background: The heroine is married to an abusive husband who has lots of money and runs the town due to his control of the logging business there. She has one great kid and one delinquent and she is beaten down by her hubby and shows more annoyance than concern for her kids who obviously are dealing with their dysfunctioanl family in their own ways but need help. She takes crap from her husband, her kids, and pretty much everyone. The hero works for an environmental agency and sees the man's wife and smiles at her after which they go to infatuation and love.OK, if she is so terrified of her husband and doesn't have the nerve to leave him, where is she getting the nerve to have an affair on him in front of the whole gossiping town (her tramp friend takes her to dinner and they are seen by everyone eatting with the hero and his coworker)?

I can't believe the paper back is 14.99 - Kindle was .99 and I still feel cheated! I really liked the premise, but the actual writing and story line was just ""lacking"", so much. I kept reading hoping it would get better and it just got worse. I really wanted to like it, but. wow, it was bad. Here are a few reasons:- Poor editing, at least on the digital version. I find that truly detracts from any story no matter how good (and more so when it's not so good).- There was suppossed to be this sexual tension and subsequent sense of falling in love between the two characters and it just wasn't there. He avoided her and they barely spoke. Her family treated him horridly (based on his great great grandfather's previous treatment of her), and she basically went along with it. They never really spoke, so where's the love? Even when she believes he's a different person (which happened way too easily), they still never had the actual falling in love - they just were, and then the were in love. Lame.- He lookd like his great great grandfather so much that only the height and build are a bit off and no one notices? Really? People tell me I look just like my mom, and yet, if you were to put us together at the same age, we would look related but not enough to pass for one another. Yet he is practically an exact replica almost how many generations later? Lame. Then it happens again later (won't say how, but really, what are the odds?). Lame.- The use of cliches and colloquialisms in writng, especially narration of a story line, is just poor writing. Characters speaking in them can be justified if it is done to make a point or to embellish a time period, but if it is done repeatedly or anachronistically it just detracts from the story line and weakens the writing. It's also freaking annoying! :)- The end is just......ok, lame. I sense a pattern. So, yeah, if you were to ask me to sum up my review in one word, I guess we know what it would be. I'd go on about the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who still wants to read it. I do think the ending is just wrong though, and it harkins back to my sentiments about them truly being ""in love"". Well, maybe she was, but him, not so much.If you love time travel romance, the best I've ever read is ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon. An incredible book. An amazing series.

Naturally this book is described as Erotic Romance and those examples were not appropriate.First off, this book is not romantic and it certainly was not steamy.  I saw no romance in this book until the very last few pages.  Other than that, the hero was strictly Master and seemed to take pleasure in the punishment.  He was not protective of her in that he made her ""get into position"", and a position that was very revealing for all to see her finer qualities who might be visiting and were allowed to touch wherever they wished while he watched.  It reminded me of the Story of O.  The entire book was focused on one aspect of her anatomy, and I hint at it in the title of this Review. There was no pleasure to pull you into the book to feel what she felt and to go ""OMG"" at steamy scenes such as books from Vivien Sparx.I have read much better Master/Submissive books wherein the Master was kind and considerate and eventually one could see something growing between the two such as love.  These Masters did not like the idea of someone else looking at her finer qualities let alone touch.  When I see the word ""romance"", I expect to see exactly that and/or something growing between the hero and heroine as the two work together in that sort of relationship. I did not see this in this book.I forced myself to read to the end hoping that it would get better.  It only got worse and to me, degrading.

Seriously???The dialog was stiff and very simple.  It was connect-the-dots conversations.  B-O-R-I-N-G!We had an emotionally unstable/abusive hero.  Several times during the story he went from normal conversation to raging, (usually at our heroine) and back again in the space of moments all the while physically abusing our poor heroine.Our heroine was a rather simplistic person...and very flat emotionally...which was a good thing since she didn't seem to mind (or even notice) the abuse.The author couldn't keep track of her own plot.  First our hero knows all the heroine's secrets...she tells him point blank...and he doesn't care, he just loves our heroine! (ahh)  Then, he's stunned (and raging [Seeing a pattern?]) to learn those same secrets later in the book.Story/plot is jerky and doesn't flow, jumping from point to point.  I think we could see how much the author wrote in one day by the plot jumps, she seemed to loose track of where she was going halfway through a scene.I just couldn't get myself to care about any of the characters.  They are all so one dimensional and flat.  Their personalities, their conversations, their emotions (even when raging) were just so...flat.The author had no understanding about 1800's medical practices.  A *Duchess* going to the doctor's office(!?) and waiting in a waiting room(!?!) and then our hero in a rage (you MUST see the pattern by now!) and barging into the exam room(!?!?!).

I've never read a book where I wanted it to end so badly. I finished ONLY because I like to finish books before I critique them.  I don't want to bash the author but I have to be honest here.The plot: Bride-to-be, Shanna finds out by supposed friend, LeToya, that her fiance, Kevin was kissing another man, Ben, on their wedding day.  Shanna runs out on the wedding and  decides to skip town by escaping to an Island where she meet top security guru Ross. They have a one-night stand ( and them some)  and Shanna begins to find contort in Ross. Later, Shanna returns home to find she is being stalked by a mystery person and starts receiving unknown phone calls as well as a robbery to one of her hair salons. She hires Ross to do some investigation and what they discover is a world of lies and betrayal by those who are closest to Shanna.My Take:This book for one, was horribly written. The plot had all the potential to be taken to the next level and failed... miserably. Granted, I understand this is an erotica book, but I was disturbed at how Shanna was able to find what the book described as ""passion"" in Ross not even knowing him for a day! For someone who just found out here fiance might be gay, she took it way to light for my liking.Aside from that, the plot ending up dying because they entire book was about Shanna and Ross having sex. I found myself skipping over several parts just to get back to the point of the story. Instead, of given details, readers are just told what happened. In all honestly, I would have rather had more details than all the sex. And BTW, the sex scene were't even good!!!! Double whammy!Overall I had more problems with the books then likes. Come to think of it, I can't say one thing I did like about the book. Not enough details, too predictable, plot that went south after page 1, and BAD SEX SCENES was just too much for me to bare.This was my first time I've read a book from this author and I'm almost inclined to say it will be my last. However, I like to give authors a couple of tries before I cut them off entirely. I will be skeptical however when I see other books by the author.

I normally dont like the BDMS thing, but when they are good they tend to be great. I did not feel this way about this book. The author takes the Dom/sub relationship way too far in this book, going into ""slave"" stuff. yuck yuck yuck.So basic plot line. Abused girl flees from an abusive jerk of a boyfriend, one who beats the crap out of her. She runs to the only safe place that she has ever known, her uncle's boat, only to discover two men living in a BDMS life and they have bought her uncle's boat. One man is an ex-cop, Sully. Clarisse doesn't trust him because he is a cop and the ""master"" in the relationship. and the other man, Mac, is the submissive. This is where I start to really dislike the book. Most of the BDMS books that I have read both men are productive in some kind of fulfilling life career. Not Mac. The whole ""slave"" thing really comes into play. All Mac does is clean the house and have sex. that's it. The men bring Clarisse into their home so that she can recover, saying that she doesnt have to participate. What??? If i was invited to someone's house after having the crap kicked out of me by a boyfriend and agreed why would you tell someone about your sex life. That would make me run in the opposite direction not toward it. it was really weird. Then as she grows to love the men, the men grow fond of her. Mac tells Sully he love Clarisse but will never leave Sully for her. Sully doesnt really admit his feelings at this time.It is kind of like Mac wants a pet of his own. So Mac tells Clarisse he loves her, but it is not really a full love because he belongs to Sully and will only ever belong to him. Sully will be the one to marry her but she is not at the same rank as Mac and if it came down to a choice Mac would win. I was more then frustrated. The men want her but I never really felt like they loved her. She really struggles with the D/s thing. I felt as though the men never really cared. They want to convince Clarisse that Dom/sub life is more then it seems but if she cant except it take a hike. But when she cant they want her to stay. To say I was confused is an understatement. So Clarisse is invited to several D/s parties, she grows to understand and except the lifestyle they are in. But she still doesn't belong to the men fully. Sully says no sex until they are married. But the weird thing is Sully and Mac did it all the time before they were truly committed with one another. Clarisse agrees to marry Sully, for the life of me i dont understand. He had not said he loved her at this point in the book. She just doesnt want to be alone, away from Mac. But Mac only kind of loves her. stupid.So after all the conflict and drama in the book's surrounding plot line (with the exboyfriend) she marries Sully. She wears both his and Mac's rings on her finger. Sully wears Mac's ring and Mac wears Sully's ring. The author makes a point to tell you this because even though Clarisse loves both men both men only really claim eachother.SO after saying all of that... I was down right annoyed with this book. YUCK!!! BDMS can be good. But when you dont have an equal relationship between the partners it is crap. I really wanted Clarisse to heal and then move out of their house. Mac for the most part only calls Sully ""master"" and then when she gets sucked into their lifestyle she does the same. Sully is the only one working and making money. Clarisse is the thirdwheel in this relationship. I hated that.I have read other books by Tymber Dalton/Macy Largo and they have been good. Sunset Hearts for example is wonderful.My advice dont waste your money.","02 18, 2011",A36KEQ5JF2UTE7,Jennifer Brown,1297987200

She has dreamed of him over the years and meeting Jake in person, she falls in instant lust. They consume their relationship pretty quickly and he bites her, therefore starting her transformation into a full-fledged werewolf.Meanwhile, her father keeps trying to get her to hunt and kill werewolves.The hunters, who know full well the wolves they are trying to kill are human, are shown as uneducated rednecks, whose collective IQ is less than 100. The werewolves are not much better. Why they would want to run wild in the woods when they know they're in danger is never quite explained. One would think that they would have leaned to control their instinct in order to survive. Or at least do something to stop the hunt (politics, law-making and media relation anyone?)But there's worse. The relationship between Sidney and her father is unhealthy and made me cringe. She's an immature little girl looking for Daddy's attention and he does not listen nor takes her feelings seriously.

One of things I love about my kindle is the ability to choose the font type.  This book as formatted some odd way that you can only view it in blocky font that can't be changed.  You can change the size but you are stuck with this obnoxious font.  I almost quit reading at that point but decided it was my own stupid fault for not reading a sample so I kept going.I am quite frankly amazed I finished it.  This book could have done with some major overhauling by a halfway decent editor. I found multiple incidents of spelling errors (liberarian instead of librarian is a good example).  The descriptive detail in the book was repetitive and distracting.  Here is a good example ""We have waited and watched, we thought they had left and then this.  Who ever it is, they had waited and watched"" or ""Quin returned to his office and went to his office""There is also the poor sentence construction through out the story.  It is a toss up if I noticed more run on sentences or fragments in this book.  Poor syntax and improper use of punctuation also constantly distracted me and ruined the reading experience.  At one point I was reminded of a high school English test I had where the teacher had deliberately made multiple errors in a story and the students were expected to find and correct all errors.As to the story line, it had potential but I just couldn't enjoy it.  The few times I was able to ignore everything I just mentioned, I found the writing stilted and boring.  Real people just don't talk like the ones in this book.  The writing  was very juvenile sounding and this could only be compared to a high school students class project.  If my teenager turned in this book for a writing class, I would expect it to come back with a C - at the very best along with a note suggesting the student resubmit it after spending more time on it.Because of all the problems I have just mentioned, this was only the second time in two years I have found myself requesting a refund for a book from amazon.  Considering the other time I asked for a refund was because I quit reading the second a pair of twin brothers started having sex with each other, that says a lot!  Even though I only paid $2 for this book, I felt ripped off and left with no choice but to ask for a refund.  Do yourself a favor and do not read this book unless you need a good example of how not to write a book.","10 31, 2011",AFIXEMW563WWG,S. weiler,1320019200

Billy notices but never mentions it.She didn't act like the baby's mother and she even mentions having a friend at the orphanage who was good with the babies. Well, Marie sure didn't tell her anything about babies because even monkeys have better natural parenting skills. They say if baby is lost in the jungle a monkey would be the best protection for them. But Vivian doesn't even have monkey sense as a mother.That and WAY TOO PREACHY.

The Hold as it is known is a prison located under the poisonous sea of Genus 6 where no one escapes from.  The Hold is a mixed gender open prison with very few lockable cells.  The prisoners are thrown together and fight amongst themselves for food.  The guards to nothing to help the prisoners it is a free for all where fighting, rape and stealing are a daily occurance.  Upon entering the prison Riana is advised by one of the guards to find the strongest man there and give herself to him as payment for his protection.So from the description of the book I was very keen and excited to read this.  It looked like an interesting plot, a women trying to survive in a dangerous futuristic prison and obviously there was going to be a guy and some romance going on, I thought it was going to be a good book from other reviews that I had read.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The start was good and the story was very bleak and dark, just my kind of thing, then Riana meets Cain the imprisoned guy she gives herself to for protection and the story turns into some kind or porn with the plot as a side story.  I was fed up reading about all the times they had sex and in what position and who was watching.  I was looking forward to one or two hot sex scenes after being teased into a frenzy by the author but this just wasn't the case.  I also didn't like the language Ms Adams used.  Don't get me wrong I am not against swearing in fact I have a bad potty mouth myself but I felt it was inappropriate.  I also didn't think this language fitted with the type of character that Riana was being portrayed as.  I so wanted Ms Adams to concentrate on the promising plot rather than how good Cain was at thrusting.  There was very little Sci-Fi in this book and I nearly gave up on it a couple of times.  I really don't like giving a negative review for a book, and please note that this is my honest opinion, as I mentioned earlier I have seen a lot of reviews for this book where people really liked it, however it just wasn't for me.

After leaving the review posted a short time, I deleted my comments.Amazon keeps suggesting I read another book in this series, something that I won't even consider doing.  Partly for that reason, I have decided to post this review.  I use other readers' reviews to help me choose books.  I always read the best and the worst that is written before making a purchase.  I normally find that after reading a book, I don't agree with the negative reviews.  In this case I do agree.I really disliked this book.  I did not find the humor humorous, and the story just seemed to plod along.  I'm not sure the main character is intelligent enough to solve a mystery.  After two or three chapters, I really didn't care if the mystery was solved or not.There are many types of humor, and I am sure that this style will appeal to some readers.  I also look for a plot that really catches my attention in the first chapter, or an appealing character.  I did not find either in this book.  Since I read for enjoyment, I wasn't interested in seeing if the pace of the story picked up later in the book.If you are looking for mysteries set in the medieval period, read  Ellis Peters' Cadfael series.  They were written some time ago and the author is deceased, but the books are still great.  I was greatly disappointed in the television production of her books.

To be honest, I stopped reading halfway through the book. It began slow and remained a slow, uninteresting read.  It lacked passion; not making love passion, but passion for life. Neither Jada or Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too `everything is perfect'.  Everybody is just so understanding and accommodating--the bit of drama with his father and her grandmother was blah.  To give an example of what I mean (and there are MANY), Aaron finally finds out almost  half way into the book that he fathered a child 5 years ago--keep in mind that Aaron and Jada kept in contact for a few months after he left and she never mentioned to him that she was pregnant. When she finally tells him he has a son, Aaron becomes overwhelmed with emotions (misty eyed) knowing that he's a father. WTH!  I think most men would be upset/angry to know that they had a child and the woman they love never told them! Not in this book; it's all good--all is well; NO PASSION.  OMG, don't let me get started on the scene when father and son finally meet. It was so over the top, it made me want to barf. Maybe if this scene had been towards the beginning of the book, it would have been touching. In the middle of the book after just too much blah it made me thrown down my kindle.  It was like eating a sweet dessert that was so sweet it made your teeth hurt. This book had a good theme, but no follow-through. Also, if we're to believe that Jada graduated from Harvard, then let it be reflected in her speech and her job. We're told that she has this wonderful personality which caused Aaron to fall in love with her--never saw it. If the author had described her as depressed and foolish--Yes! I would believe it in a heartbeat. She was boring. This book was so frustrating to read.  I truly struggled to read it as far as I did.

From the clumsy dialog to the sloppy plot line to the incredibly bad writing this book was a failure.  For example, there is a point at which the protagonist is helping someone up.  The prose reads something like ""Jonathan reached out his hand and Jonathan took it.""  I am not kidding.  Now, that may be slightly paraphrased, but the essentials are there.  For example, there is a battle in an office building where the police are getting absolutely creamed.  Do they stop and regroup?  Does anybody say ""these tactics are not working?""  Nope.  They continue fighting using the old methods until practically everyone is dead.These same mistakes are made over and over and over again in this novel.  I will say that those few snippets about the Christian Faith that Mr. Somers shared were pretty spot on, even if clumsily delivered, but that's about as far as I am willing to go to provide praise for this book.  If you are bored silly, and for some reason absolutely nothing else is available and if you can get this book for free, then go ahead and read it.  Otherwise spend your money on something else.  C. S. Lewis' space trilogy is a better choice, or perhaps Kathy Tyers' Firebird trilogy if you can find it.  Anything by Bill Myers makes this guy look worse than amateurish, though his Charismatic leanings come through pretty strongly.  Look, just find something else to buy.

6595,B003VYAY8K,"[10, 11]",1,"**May Contain Spoiler**Where to begin with Only One Love? The premise of the book is good. The idea of lost love that spans literally life times is a great concept. However, this story took a horrible turn into the unbelieveable when it went extreme paranormal and then never really elaborated on it. There was already the special ancient abilities in the Grayhawk family their really didn't need to be more. It didn't add to the story it only took away from it.The hero, Peyton, was totally different than he was in the other books of the series. In the other books he was charming, fun, reliable and in this one he was whiny and selfish. What he does to Cam is really messed up. I could've gotten past it but then he kept whining about it. I wanted to jump into the book and say ""man up!"" And don't get me started on the heroine, Avantae. She was a selfish, spineless, nymphomaniac. All she kept trying to do is get Peyton even though it would ruin his relationship with Cam. Clearly, she learned nothing from her previous lifes mistakes. She pretended to care how Cam felt but she didn't care. Then when she should have put her foot down and stood up for herself she let everyone just lead her around and make decisions for her.All the women of this series are all the same. They don't object to anything, the don't stand up for themselves, they have no self-esteem, they have to be willing to give up everything they are for these men, they have to be willing to come last when it comes to the Grayhawk family and the only thing they can expect to get from their so called ""loves"" is frequent sex, but God forbid they have any desire to be put first at any point. The men sacrifice nothing for these women the women do all the bending, all the waiting, all the being patient, all the understanding and if they ever complain along comes one of the Grayhawk siblings to tell them how beneath their family they are and how lucky they should feel that one of the Grayhawk men even looked their way so they better just accept however they're getting treated or they won't be treated at all. What the women want doesn't matter to the Grayhawk men.And talk about needing their egos stroked. This Grayhawk family need to leave the women of the world alone and just be with each other. All they want is someone to stroke their ego for them. If I had to read about how amazing one of them were again I would have thrown up. It was a little over kill on the Hawk-you're-so-great train. It was so repetitive ""No, you're the best"" ""No, you're the best"" ""No, your better than I am"" ""Oh, no, I'm nothing compared to you, Hawk,"" man, it got bad.The sad thing is I actually like the author. Her book Skin Deep was excellent I loved it, but this series needs emotionally stronger women and a little more give on the male leads part. I'm all for Alpha male but these guys don't care at all for their women. The women add nothing to their lives accept for one more person to toot their horn and are little more than glorified sex toys. All in all I'm giving up on this series but not on the author because she does have the ability to tell a good balanced story, but this series just isn't it.","01 31, 2011",A26SG61U07YZ3U,W.

The sex scenes were good, if a little corny at times, (really, having sex while he sprouts wings and levitates them above the bed?!).  That's about the only thing this book was good for.  The author's descriptions of anything except the sex scenes were poor, (I never even felt like there was a decent description of what the dragon form looked like).  And the heroine was incredibly foolish and weak, repeatedly getting herself into scrapes he has to save her from.  I HATE stories with weak women constantly in need of rescue.Amazon needs to introduce a refund program, so you can get at least some of your money back for bad purchases.

I am really just sick of reading about women who cow down to a man because he knows how to get them off.

Yet he know that she is an expert shot and he gives her a gun. And she saves his butt after breaking out of the closet. For a second you think she grew a backbone when she tells him that when it counted, he didn't keep his word, and tells him again to sign the divorce papers. He finally does, but now she can't go through with it, and goes back to him ready to apologize. For what? Sticking up for yourself? And I really wanted to scream when he handcuffs her to the bed and she asks ever hurt you?"" Um...he just drugged her a few hours before, and then handcuffed her to himself before handcuffing her to the headboard so he had both his hands to ""help her loosen up"". Yeah, I would call drugging someone hurting them. I don't care if it's because you're supposedly trying to protect them or not. Geez!And when she finally gets him to agree to let her handcuff him to the bed, she teases him for all of 30 seconds, because the lustful look in his eyes was just too much, before she caves and starts riding him.

Unfortunately, this book was a huge disappointment - I had to force myself to finish it.  Many times I stopped reading, went on to another book that I actually enjoyed and then forced myself to go back to it with the hope that it would improve to only be more disappointed.  I just could not get interested in the story or characters.The main characters, Kiran and Logan are really the Norse Gods, Loki and Baldur.  A major problem for me in the first half of the book was that I simply could not keep straight which character was which god and had what supernatural powers.  I have read Federal Tax Laws that were clearer.  While the Norse Gods concept was unique, it was also very confusing to the reader unless one was very knowledgeable about Norse mythology in the first place.  The Norse mythology was also a little too much for such a short novel because it forced the author to find a way to introduce the different Norse Gods, their different powers and relationship to each other which just led to MAJOR bewilderment.  Many times things were not clear until much later in the book when the reader was fed a little more background on the Norse mythology which then made a much prior passage make sense, somewhat, sometimes.  The story might be interesting if reread after a ""cheat sheet"" concerning Norse mythology is made by the reader but quite frankly I still do not think I would be any more interested in the characters or story than I was the first time around.As for the ""hot sex"" scenes that another reviewer mentioned - maybe explicit but that did not make them ""hot"".  To me, the scenes were more of a ""throw in"" because that's what is expected in a book that is supposed to be an erotic romance and I had long stop caring whether there was any romance between the characters.Note to Author:  Please Dana - return back to the Halle Shifter series and let this series stay in the past like Norse mythology.","11 24, 2010",AYZ3XI8VSE6C1,Rare Reviewer,1290556800
7584,B00371V7WO,"[0, 1]",1,"I didn't finish this book, got bored hence the default 1* rating. Poorly written, not enough detail, gaping plot holes, and tedious.I'm not sure what category to put this in - this story is- NOT erotica (As some reviewers have pointed out. Not enough sexual tension etc);- NOT SciFi; far too unimaginative and unsophisticated;- NOT well written enough or engrossing to be a good story- hence may be it's geared towards the tender romance variety? But I didn't feel any chemistry for that either.Overall, perhaps it's just a little bit of the above genres but not enough to be any of thoseI like books that capture my interests. There are some books that require one to read a good few chapters before one is engrossed. Due to the gaping plot holes, the poor writing style and lack of imagination this didn't intrigue me.=================The Characters:Heroine: Mari speaks many different languages and is a linguist, hence she picks up the Alien language very quickly. Her age wasn't really mentioned in the chapters I read, but the readers are informed on numerous occasions that she has vivid red hair (I assume she's a natural ginger sans freckles). She's defiant and originally challenges her captors. However, after the hero spares her, she's rather mellow and doesn't seem freaked out by being far away from earth and living in Alien territory.Hero: apart from being rather tall with cat like eyes, there's not much Alien about him that i could tell. Mari, the heroine describes him as resembling Native Americans, however, I've never seen bronze 7 feet Native Americans (the few I met were mixed heritage and resembled light-skinned Hispanic). He's rather mild, not the Alpha Male type. Basically, he's a tall, dark handsome cliche found in chick lit but with feline eyes. It's unfortunate the author didn't make him purple or blue skinned with horns on his head or something more imaginative. Tall, bronze skinned with long black hair reminds me of men I've seen from certain Middle Eastern countries and Punjab.================Plot holes:I'm not going to mention the glaringly obvious plot holes or I'll give away the story. However, a few are:1. The Alien species can speak English. Even the heroine points out that if one can converse with a species than it doesn't make much sense to allocate them as pets or food? The responding argument was not convincing enough to make this plot work. Even during the slavery trade - one of the reasons why slavers believed they were dealing with inferior species was because they believed the Africans they dealt with did not have a formal language or a proper culture.2. The Aliens believe that the humans are primitive and don't posses a proper culture. Considering that Earth has satellite it would be pretty easy for the Aliens to pick up a huge amount of data which would prove that humans have a form of electronic communication, entertainment and civilisation. The Aliens own form of living isn't very sophisticated hence I didn't understand why they thought they were so much more superior? I appreciate it might be a denial process (to justify the capturing of women) but again far too far fetched an argument. The Aliens technology such as their ""blackberry"" type hand held computer would be easily spotted by any number of aliens visiting earth.3. Considering the Aliens were suffering plagues and so forth - surely earth would have far more valuable possessions than human meat that would help them - additionally, you'd think they'd have sophisticated vaccinations or protective gear too.4. Mari manages to convince the Aliens within a space of a few minutes that she ought to be allowed to stay awake and engage in conversation with them. It seems that the aliens capitulated far too quickly. The story also jumps so one minute she's woken up and confronting them and the next minute we're told it's been a few days and they're impressed by her oddity.5. The Aliens do not look much different from many humans living on Earth. If they'd traveled to South East Asia, the Middle East or even the Far East they'd see beings much like them. Hence, their incredulity over Mari being able to engage in conversation with them is baffling. In fact even if they were to visit Norway or Iceland they'd find Viking like tall people (when I go there I feel like a munchkin and I'm 5.9). Hence, the story just wasn't convincing.I can't get into the reasons properly because I don't want to give away the story. I think it would be better if the Aliens found Mari in a primitive planet where her spaceship and stranded. The beings of that planet could be primitive but human physically and thus they mistaken her for one of them - when she's out bathing or something. She eventually slowly learns a few of their tongue and thus they are shocked by her even talking to them.================Summary of Plot:Mari (a human) was collecting eggs when she's captured by an Alien species with the intention to sell her at a meat market (humans are an expensive delicacy for certain species). The Aliens failed to tranquilize her properly and hence she wakes up to find herself naked and trapped in a cage on a cargo spaceship.She engages with her captors who are surprised by her ""intelligent"" form of interaction as they assume humans to be uncivilised and non-sentient beings. When they try to return her to hypersleep, she resists. Within the space of a few minutes and without much persuasion she manages to convince them to allow her to stay awake and in a page or two later she's managed to persuade the Hero that's she's not a pet or food.","08 29, 2013",A29I38KDR45ZLY,"Goddess of Blah Book Reviews ""Goddess of Blah""",1377734400

It has major editing, sentence structure, missing word, wrong word (I stopped counting at 15), research, continuity, and suspension of disbelief issues. These problems become more and more pronounced as the story progresses.To a greater or lesser extent, this seems to be a recurring problem with all of Ms. Druga's literary efforts.The story opens with the main protagonist Jen using a scope mounted rifle to shoot an infected.  Later on, when this same event is described, she uses a shotgun.The character Mack, a supposed expert 'gun maker and repairman' (the term for which, by the way, is 'gunsmith'), instead talks like an author who has no real grasp of firearms and firearms technology.  Later on in the story, Mack builds 'an anti-aircraft gun' and shoots down two ground attack aircraft with it.  'Anti-aircraft gun' is all the description given; no clue as to caliber, system of operation, or any other detail.I found the author's woefully inadequate grasp of military terms, tactics, equipment and operations particularly annoying.  It's just as easy to do a little research and get this stuff right as it is to just make stuff up based on what you think you know.And the same caveat with the fancy words - it's not a bad idea to make sure you actually know what they mean before you use them.Handled differently and given more (any) fact-checking, editing, and attention to detail, this could have been a hell of a read.

The characters are hardly believable. Event the prologue begins with the actual story, not in the past when Kasie overheard the conversation between Amory and her father. That would have set the story up. I mean, come on, who says being a tomboy means you can't be a real woman, which is what is intimated in this novel. Or that women have certain work they should be doing and men have other work and neither the twain shall meet? She actually used the term woman's work! What is with the whole virtue thing also? I men, if my father asked me if I had been violated at age 24, I would have told him to mind his own business. She's been engaged twice but is still has not been violated? Who says that? At least make it a life style choice. By the way, I'm not a 20 something, I'm a grandmother. Also, smoking indoors? Really? And only the mean light up? What century are we in? That is part of the problem with this novel. Most of the time as I read this, I felt like I was reading one that took place 100 years ago, not today. However, the female lead character is a computer programmer. There are secondary characters that are stuck in just to explain the plot but the connections are never made between them and the main characters. And then we have the idea that the main character is a bigot and that's why she didn't marry the guy in the first place. I mean, wasn't she terribly hurt by him and that's why she left? And her father is married to a Native American. On that note, who uses the term Indian any more? I managed to finish this book, but only because I hoped it would improve. It didn't.

Sadly, this is not one of them.The premise of Daughter of Deception is promising, and I was looking forward to discovering the different types of demons as Duke and Viola hunted.  I was unable to finish the book for a few reasons.1.  Like so many indie books, the lack of effective editing made it nearly unreadable.  I'm not saying responsibility doesn't lie with the author, but when you have an untried writer, a good editor makes all the difference.  Thorpe had many errors in tense, which became worse further into the book.  A sentence that made it past the copy editor: ""Viola shifted her grip on the knife's hilt, fights fought a wave of nausea..."" makes it obvious the author struggled with tense.2.  Her characters were inconsistent, so it was difficult to pick out motivations.  Viola expends a great deal of effort to get back in the Network, then quits after her first job?  She starts out self-assured and sharp, but quickly becomes something of a mess.  I wondered where the interesting heroine portrayed in the sample went.3.  Brief, unwarranted shifts in point of view were disorienting.  It really doesn't matter that much what Olivia thinks when on the phone with Viola.  Just stick with Viola.  Omniscience almost never works.Thorpe absolutely shows promise.  She has imagination that will serve her well down the road.

I also loved the way she develops her characters romantically, sexually, mentally and emotionally and that's what attracts me to her writing and her books. This is not the norm for Ms. Brooks.

It was kind of like Twilight meets I Am Legend.If you do not like the YA genre, then this is not the book for you. With that said, I am not a fan of the YA so I struggled reading this book. The premise of the story seems a bit too immature for an adult audience. Starla and her friend Jordan become vampires so that they can be wealthy and glamorous but the story opens with the two friends standing outside of Jordan former childhood home; now kicked out and homeless because of her new vampiric state. The two Blood Sisters resign themselves to their new status and go looking for their first ""meal"" as vampires. They stumble upon a house with a former classmate who was reviled by Jordan because he used her sexually and then threw her away. A midnight snack and revenge at the same time...two birds, one stone. Perfect, right? Wrong, the girls' effort is thwarted by a usurper. He stole their meal and drained their first meal dry...taking away the opportunity for a meal and revenge. Darn!Poor girls...now, what are they gonna do, it's not like they can pick up blood in aisle thirteen at their local grocer. Nope, they have to figure out another food source. They continue their hunting and wind up at a local nightclub. They target a young girl, a doppelg&auml;nger for Starla according to Jordan, as their victim. The girls have their first food fight, literally, as the battle over who will win the quarry. Their first attempt of food acquiry ends in an epic failure. Their young victim escapes them while they are fighting each other over who gets to draw first blood. Starla's ""twin"" runs back into the club shrieking and the girls end up hungry...still.Pitiful humans turned into pathetic vampires...not a pretty picture at all. After their failed attempt to secure food, the girls find themselves at the playground where they were turned into vampires. Their arrival at the playground commences a sequence of events that change their vampiric lives forever.I say that this book reminds me of I am Legend because the vampires were described as completely hairless (even the females) with a gray skintone.The story struck me as disjointed. I could see where the pieces were supposed to connect but they were done so haphazardly. It was as if puzzle pieces of the story were dumped on the floor and the reader had to put the picture together. Mystery or suspense novel provide the reader with pieces or clues so that they can put together the final picture to figure outwho done it, why'd they do it, or what happened. However, since this book fit into neither genre it was not a particularly enjoyable experience piecing together the why's and what's of the story.The characters were just too juvenille to have broader appeal to an adult audience. The primary character ages were about sixteen or seventeen. Starla and Jordan were very scatterbrained (per impulsive descision to become a vampire without thinking through the ramifications); shallow (Starla vandalized and robbed a store to get a leather coat, boots, and sunglasses); and whiny (Starla didn't want to drink blood which made her weak...human...but raged and moaned when someone refered to her as such). Such a spastic trichotomy.Then there was the whole storyline of Mercer's grandfather being able to purify Starla's blood since she hadn't drank human blood. They were going to perform a dialysis of sorts and remove her blood, purify it, and put it back into her body and voila the vampire demon would be excised from her body turning her into a half-human, like Mercer. Dialysis...hmmm...really?!?! The description of the entire process was just too pedestrian. The story definately could have been made more if that storyline and process had been fleshed out a bit more.My feelings on the book are neutral; I did not totally hate it but, most likely, will not read it again. The book began with automatic strike for me because it was a YA which I do not typically read. However, in spite of my non-YA book policy, I have read one or two others and actually enjoyed them because they appealed to me on an intellectual level. The stories were mature in a way that elminiated the teen fiction novel feel.

Lots of steamy sex, mostly anal as one reviewer noted. I don't have a problem with sex scenes if they are integral to the story, but there was no story. The story unfolds with a scoundrel trying to kiss the h. The H sees his wife in the kiss but does not see her slap the scoundrel. He becomes impotent after seeing his wife in the embrace. He heads out to a brothel and for a number of months relieves his frustrations via voyeurism. His wife follows him one day and the Madame tells her that he has only been with himself but he is wavering. She suggests that the h disguises herself as a French whore with a mask and be with her husband when he succumbs to temptation. The h does so and the H breaks down in a big way. He cheats on his wife with his whore wife. After his first tryst, he is hooked and looks forward to each visit. I stopped reading and started skimming about here.When the H was cheating, he did not feel guilty about the wife at home or the kids. All he could think with was with his d*** and what it wanted.

I downloaded it due to the time period and subject matter. I'm glad it was free, because it's not worth any amount of money.  If the author thinks this will entice readers to try her other offerings, she is mistaken. Aside from the formatting errors and typographical errors (extra or misplaced punctuation, missed words, misspellings, etc.), this book is littered with sentences that simply make no sense. ""Her honey touched brown hair glistened under the late winter sun and the dew from the grass also hung in the sky on her nose."" What? ""He drove over the roads he grew up on as a child, riding his bicycle and falling from it for the first time, over the roads he walked to school on, over the roads he had his first kiss."" Good grief.I could picture the author with a well-thumbed thesaurus in her lap, searching for an unusual word to take the place of the common. It gives the book a seriously disjointed feel.The degree of detail is mind-numbing. I don't think I ever found a noun that didn't have an adjective attached to it, and many had three or four.""She snipped a few deep pink roses with the pruning scissors she kept in her side skirt pocket, a pocket stitched just below a 1920's German Dresden Wire Mesh purse dangling from her left shoulder."" Or, ""A wood picnic table under a large cascading tree sat next to a blue green lake. Two lit candles sat in the middle of the worn wood table with two plates of delicacies... Two long elegant glasses stood next to each plate, filled to the brim with white champagne. Rebecca in gaiety scuttled to the decorated table and smelled the plate of food as she sat. She laid her Dresden Wire Mesh handbag on the chair beside her. The soft painted pink petals and pale green leaves decorating the bag were a perfect compliment to the nature encompassing them.""People in this book rarely just move from one place to another. They bounce, scramble, lunge, scamper, scuttle, leap, plod, amble, or stumble, sometimes for no apparent reason.""Rebecca leapt into the air, eager to enjoy the Valentine meal with the man she loved."" And yeah, sometimes they just jump around for the heck of it. They rarely just speak. They bellow, interject, argue, insist, giggle, demand. And guffaw. Now, guffaw is a word one might use once in a novel with the right tone. The author used this word no less than four times in the first 35% of this novel.It seems like every new scene gets a full description of what each character is wearing. ""Eli took off his long, brown coat and wrapped it around Rebecca before they sat. She snuggled with his coat pulled over her long, beige skirt, white blouse and sweater, burrowing her head into his shoulder and neck.""Dangling participles and odd sentence construction ruin the flow of the writing, to the point where there is no flow at all. The author head-hops, changing POV willy-nilly. Where was the ""editor""? None of this should end up in a published book.Finally, this book contains the most ludicrous ""love"" scene I've ever had the misfortune to read. I actually guffawed. At that point the novel turned into a parody for me. I could no longer take it seriously.I only made it to 37% and had to give up.

Unfortunately, what we have here is an inane full length book that should have been a short story at best.  It is 5% story and 95% filler fluff.I keep asking myself WHEN novice story writers will cop to the fact that page after page of painful inner dialogue by the main (or any) character is a sure fire way to make any book a big fat zero.This 'book' is all over the place.  The author would have done well to sit down prior to writing and compose an outline as to what the main theme of the book would be and then FOLLOW that outline.  There is so much ridiculous, extraneous activity going on that it is close to impossible to follow what I took to be the main point of the book: the murder of Manny and the protagonist's unwilling involvement in the crime.In one scene you have some silly mishmash about an upcoming wedding, in several others you have Jessie doing battle with the big 'meanies' in her life...characters, by the way, who are so one dimensional as to be laughable.  In other scenes she is agonizing over a long dead romance (ten years) when her erstwhile lover turns out to be lead investigator on the murder at hand.These characters insult the reader's intelligence mercilessly.  Are we really supposed to believe that Jessie, after narrowly escaping death and then having her house torched, lists wearing a hideous maid of honor dress in her sister's wedding as one of her top three current concerns?  Give me a break.Another idiotic character is that of Jessie's mother.  This is a woman who supposedly made her way through medical school and became a respected surgeon while at the same time raising two children and yet whose main focus is getting her daughters married off.  The mindset just doesn't jibe.I find myself skipping page after page after page of imbecilic tripe just to get to the next coherent passage that might just relate to the mystery at hand.I'm afraid that whomever murdered Manny will have to remain a mystery to me because I've lost all patience with this miserable excuse for a book.","01 12, 2012",AFAIEJL65GKRK,DeeDee Brown,1326326400

The book cover of the female vampire biting into the male is very eye-catching and appealing. The book trailer is equally appealing. I should have loved this book...I wanted to love this book...but there are two reasons primarily why this didn't happen and both can be remedied.I actually think the plot of the story is pretty good: A vampire is hired to hunt down a werewolf. I think that the book could potentially be very good with more character development which, perhaps, could be achieved by extending the length of the novella. It is fun to enjoy a bad-ass protagonist like Rose, but I think she could be even better! I particularly liked the character of Bobbie, the fire witch.Unfortunately, the review copy that I was given is fraught with grammatical and spelling errors, which made it difficult to read and interfered with my enjoyment of the book.With a good editor and more character depth, the book could be improved.MY RATING: 1 star","08 27, 2011",A2QPHFMY9D5AH7,Darlene,1314403200

It sounded like an interesting story. I usually like paranormal's a lot. This one really disappointed me.There is only one view point. That view point is extremely self involved.

This book could have been at least half the size with better editing, and having a second point of view would have made it more readable.The very large leaps in thinking by Meagan, without any backstory to help it, just doesn't work well.

I finished the book but skipped parts here and there to get it over with.

And why does all the women have to be impregnated in the books and in such an offensive manner in this book? I am sorry, but it is not realistic at all, that a woman would just shrug her shoulders by being impregnated against her will. Add to that the fact that all seem to be lying to Jaide and she at some point apologises for having trust issues with Skye because of his and the others' lies is really beyond me. Also a lot of her actions seems to stem from something I cannot pick up.

The main characters all seemed to be the same person with different names and it was hard to distinguish one from another. There were characters named Baider, Paider and Kaider in the novel and that only added to my confusion.The 2 main characters (Who could have been the same guy from all the lack of differentiation in their personalities/descriptions) spent all their time pondering their and their crewmate's relationships while fighting off aliens. Maybe its just me but if I am dodging aliens and running for my life, I am not wondering if one of my crew members is sleeping with the gorgeous doctor on board the ship...and thats another thing...everyone in the book seems to be extremely well built and drop dead handsome or Supermodel material...what, there are no ugly people in the future?One guy seems to start out white then suddenly he's described as African-American and then the book later speaks of his pale complexion....what's that all about? All the women in the book spend their time crying over the smallest incident or completely breaking down and cracking under pressure so that the males in the book feel repeatedly obligated to comfort them, put their arms around them and tell them it will be alright.The locals of the future apparently speak redneck and after reading several chapters of words written like they are spoken as in ""Yuens folks git long now, ain't no cause fer alarm..."" (I made that line up, but you get the picture), I just couldn't take it anymore.Anyways, thats my 2 cents worth.

And someone is threatening her life.This is the sequel to ""Broken Wings"" and, if I didn't know any better, I'd wonder if the main character was a different person. Yes, there's this blurb in the beginning saying she's been forced to forget her soul connection by the powers that be, but now she's clueless and helpless. Unfortunately, all of her coworkers at the FBI seem to be inept as well. I mean, Rio can go deep undercover to trap a mobster on a case that took years to develop, yet she and her colleagues can't handle one little stalker? And they break procedure numerous times regarding the threatening letters. Any civilian friend or relative who interrupted or threatened an undercover operation would be in big trouble, possibly arrested for interfering with police procedure, and the agent involved would be censured and maybe even fired. In her previous work you can tell the author did some background work. This thing is full of more holes than Swiss cheese.Dialogue and romantic development has also taken a serious nosedive. Propositioning the love interest by saying, ""Oh baby....Let me help you. Let me ease your pain""? Oh, please let me not read another nauseating cliche! There are several places where scene transition is rough or illogical, grammar errors are more egregious, and, to top it off, the author rewrote the main character's history.

This story, however, was just not that good.  The dialogue was a bit unbelievable, the characters  didn't make sense to me.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a good, well thought out, well told story.  This just didn't meet any of that criteria for me.We're supposed to believe that Max, as a PI successful enough to hire employees for his PI/security firm, instead of following the subject of his investigation follows instead the teacher of a dance class that he found attractive.  While he follows her we get this constant stream of his inner dialogue, which I didn't find to be very humorous or enlightening.  It was just annoying.Jordan, the subject of Max's stalking, goes to a bar with some students from her dance class.  See's Max, gathers up her courage to hit on him, and then let's him feel her up on the dance floor and promptly takes him to her house.... Really??  Later that night, after a bit of trouble at her house, she's upset he didn't tell her that he was in security.  Um... when was he supposed to tell her?...  when he had his tongue down her throat or during sex?In the first half of the book there was nothing likable about the characters.  Max comes off as a stalker, who you question how he ever gained the skill or discipline to be the owner of a successful PI/security firm.  Jordan comes off as unreasonable and paranoid. Overall, that gives me no reason to read further, neither character were likable or relate-able.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a far fetched story, but the characters, and their actions, should make sense within the context of that story.Now, don't think I have high expectations for Shakespearean-like story telling for every author I read.

It was to be the start of an obsessive Galway glom through a two-week vacation.  So looking forward to it.Glom stopped in its tracks.From the premise to the characters to the actions of the characters throughout it was just upsetting and puzzling.The female protag is a grad student conducting a study.  In this study she feels it is responsible behavior to engage in sex with the study's subjects.  But wait, she isn't going to tell them they are part of the study.  Or wait, maybe the plan was to tell them they were in a study, but with her first and only study ""partner"" she gets personally involved and just can't bring herself to break the mood by having him sign the consent form.So she has wild passionate sex with this guy on an exercise bench.  Can you say cooties?  I don't care if it is in his home and it is his personal bench, seems like a great place to pick up some germs.Then she has a conference with her advisor.

First, the lead lady Shauna was a woman who just could not make up her friggin' mind about whether she was ashamed of being seen with Miles or not. And when they argued about it, never really set the issue straight as to where it wouldn't be thrown in her face again. Second, there so much negativity the relationship between Miles and Shauna could go no where but down. Shauna and Miles were constantly at war with each other except when it came to sex and that had been her main issue all along. If the two couldn't make it a week without verbally sparring, then why be together? And his off the side, eager Rita -- personally that character had me applauding only because she didn't care about anything but getting laid. IMO Miles was more reasonable than Shauna, who the reader is lead to believe is the more practical one. I felt there were too many details on the innerworkings of cable companies, too much on the white/black issue that wasn't resolved between the couple, too much sex and bickering over indecisiveness along with a lack of development between Miles getting to know her daughter, Shauna dealing with finalizing her relationship with Mr. I'm-Too-Sexy-For-Myself Clarance and Celeste, who wasn't supportive despite how the writer seemed to state otherwise. If I brought a man to meet a friend and she went off on him like Celeste did, no matter what color he was, she would have been on my bad side for a very long time. And the ending was done poorly. Why stop with Miles being attacked by dogs, Shauna searching and not finding him until reaching home where he's sitting on the stoop waiting for her at which point everything is sunshine and lemonade between the two, the end.

It is hard to describe without using the words pulp fiction. Which has come to mean something else. I see this style as belonging on supermarket shelves - mass fiction which needs no thought. And then the story. It is a good premise, the kind of is he isn't he . Childhood memories that are missing and therefore our killer could be our author. Even he does not know. I worked it out half way through. I lost patience then with our hero's stupidity and interest along with it.

It has been years since I read Stephen King to whom this author is compared in some of these rave reviews. From what I remember of Mr. King I see no resemblence. Stephen King is a master of suspense.

They intimate this is an old document that has value for historical purposes. Maybe doing it this way the author thought he could be excused for his avid descriptions of brutality and human indignity. If he wanted us to accept his ideas he should have presented a more balanced story that included more detail about why the hero could be so strong; in particular his relationships with his mother and stepbrothers. His mad stepfather's vicious behaviour came out of nowhere; why would his mother marry a guy like this?

Naturally, she calls the wedding off, and as she is fleeing the scene, still wearing her wedding dress, who should appear but her teenage crush.  She hasn't seen him for twelve years, but he whisks her away, and they proceed to have sex as often as possible, preferably nude and outdoors on the deck of the hero's beach house.  It goes without saying that every time they have sex, it's better than the last time.  Unfortunately, there's nothing there that we haven't read before, dozens of times, and that scene with the melted chocolate has been done so many times it was embarrassing to read it again.The book could also do with a good copy editor.  It's riddled with mistakes like ""daring-do"" for ""derring-do"", ""me and you"" instead of ""you and I"", and the hero wanting the heroine ""bad"" not badly.  They are a real distraction from what little plot there is.Ms. Saints has done her homework, and manages to include almost all of the cliches for this genre.  The heroine's family is rich and evil.

Somehow, they are produced, written and made; but in so many cases, you end up wondering...what were they thinking?In this case, the author seems to have stitched together a ponderous book with a plot line that simply makes no sense. Earth's ozone layer has failed, evidently causing a caste system in which some unspecified ""elite"" end up in domes, and the rest of humanity ends up...not in domes, evidently too stupid to stay indoors. To try to make this all plausible, the author creates a new kind of radiation: One that apparently deteriorates concrete, steel and brick so that it crumbles. Not the domes, of course: somehow, THOSE materials are impermeable.Scratching your head yet? How about these little gems:--The futuristic military is ultra-smart, ultra-mechanized, and ultra-equipped...except when they have to go somewhere in the dark. Then, they fumble and stumble around because in this universe, night vision goggles were never invented.--The outside-the-dome citizens are emaciated, radiation-ravaged and prone to bleeding and dying at a moment's notice...except when the citizens are related to the main character. Then, they perform superhuman feats over several days with various injuries and little food with no apparent problems.--In a world where all the land is described as arid, lifeless and barren, half the characters drown their sorrows with a good cigarette. Which is made of tobacco. Which is grown...where exactly?--The author has decided that virtually every noun deserves an adjective and every verb deserves an adverb. Glass never breaks - it breaks softly. Honestly. No one ever stares - they universally stare coldly or hotly, and both words are apparently interchangeable to the author. I daresay there are 3,000 completely superfluous words in this novel attributable to useless adjectives and adverbs.Indeed, there are whole passages that are redundant and serve to do nothing to advance the story. In this universe, military men conduct 20-minute long conversations to debate the pros and cons of helping a stranded soldier in the middle of an epic battle, and the dialogue is incessant in its repetition.Even with an editor and a halving of the story (and believe me, it would be easy to cut this novel in half), there is simply no character development that makes you want to root for the hero or his family. Oh...and the sequel? It contains virtually no ties or links to the initial story.All in all, this is one hot mess of a book. With so many other quality independent titles and authors out there, I can't recommend this even at its current zero price.

The attraction and the sex are still ablaze after five years keeping the need for condoms all over the house high.

It was a ten minute read. Definately a short story. Don't expect a novella. There just isn't enough there to justify my time or the two bucks.

Maybe a little experimentation out of the box?? Heck we are talking pagans here right?

Normally I don't feel I should rate something I have not been able to read from start to finish. I have to feel very strongly about an unfinished book to post an opinion about it.It was a very interesting premise, which is what prompted me to pick it up. I'm an animal person myself, have always wished I could communicate with animals and the plot sounded interesting.I got a third of the way through the book. Very little plot apparent even at that point, unfortunately. However, what absolutely turned me off this book was the rampant pro-PETA/HSUS agenda that was, as far as I could tell from reading as far as I did, the main objective of the author and the reason for the book. Not the story, anyway.The rescue of the sled dogs abandoned by dog sled racing people was bad. The description of lab animals when the main character was a child and her step father arbitrarily took her pet rabbit to be a lab test animal even worse. But what really capped it for me is when there was a long description of the 'memory' of the life of a commercially-raised chicken triggered by the main character taking a bite of cooked chicken. That was the last straw for me.I realize everyone has their own ideas about things but 'message' is one thing and trying to stuff something down by throat, calling it entertainment is something else entirely.Members of PETA or HSUS may get by these things without a problem. There may be a plot in the last 2/3 of the book that I didn't get to. However, like the main character being unable to swallow the bite of chicken, I couldn't stomach reading any more of the book.","02 28, 2012",A1SSRL4Q0QHZFR,Sharon,1330387200

There was a small thread of ""escape Bedlam"" that was just unbelievable and after pages and pages of nothing it was accomplished in a spur of the moment afterthought way.  From what I could gather the plot line consisted of absurd sex scenes (really? hours after meeting a filthy, epileptic crazy man she is ""tiddling"" on the floor of an insane asylum with him? really?) interspersed with, well, not much more.The hero was a sniveling, blushing ""genius"" with no real depth.  If he blushed or ""brushed away a tear"" again I might have had to break my kindle.  The heroine was a self-centered little sleaze.  Her first concern was always the crazy man she had just met, not her totally incoherent sister or anyone else who had been there for her through all of her troubles.The editing started out okay, for a cheap kindle book, but it was almost like by the end even the editor/proofreader was just skimming as the spelling and punctuation errors increased dramatically.The dialogue was unbelievable and almost painful to read.  The H & h's soliloquies of ""love and devotion"" were nauseating in the way they went on and on and on page after page all the way through.  We get it, they love each other like no one has ever loved before and will be there for each other forever and would give up their lives for the other.  There were times when a character would use a phrase or word that was just not true to the time but in the whole scheme of how bad this book was this was minor.I am still not sure what the heck happened in the ending.  I know there were tears and ""happily ever after"" with the promise of more to come---not for this reader though!--after a silly chase scene where it all ""came together"" and all made sense to everyone---not!The supporting characters were as inane and uninspiring as the mains---none were developed in a way that made them feel like real contributing parts of the story.There is so much more I could comment on that made this book bad, but I have already wasted too much time I will never get back on it.","09 8, 2012",A2SBNIQK0K5XDD,Lady ReadsaLot,1347062400

Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.

It was reminiscent of those old-time movies where the ""feisty"" girl reporter is told not to go into the cellar and of course, the first thing she does is just that. Izzy, told not to go into the woods by just about everyone she meets, does just that too.The characters were not ""fleshed out"" sufficiently for me to have much sympathy for them - we know next to nothing about Feathers, the son, Connor, or his father, Joe (who turns out to be an elf) or the abusive ex-boyfriend/husband/partner. His threats and leaving mutilated animals on her doorstep is not taken very seriously by the police.There is no back story to speak of which would explain the circumstances of Izzy's life - a few letters to her rellies is all the reader gets. The ending was abrupt and the last chapter jumps forward a year without explaining what's going on with Izzy, Feathers and Connor. It's as though the author couldn't decide how to finish it and opted for the easiest way out.I abhore novels where animals are killed so that made me very distressed.

The author clearly has a world that she wants to develop, but unfortunately tries to do so all in the first chapter. Paragraph after paragraph of expository background.  The cast of characters is stereotyping 101. We have the tough, scary leader, his straight talking right hand man, the bookish historian and the lover that no one ever rejects (and a couple of less developed others - I guess in case the series needs expanding). Now I know what I'm reading.  When I'm looking at books like this, (as the blurb says: Mehen must protect mortals from the undead... has never struggled with the task--until he saves a woman from three undead, and finds himself in need of saving) I know I'm not passing through the frosty upper echelons of high literature. As a result, my expectations were not that high. Overall, it's not a bad story, it's just not a *good* story.  The plot is roughly handled with some chapters reading as filler between random and pointless sex scenes. The main female character is so bland she was almost irrelevant.There are also the odd turns of phrase that an editor should have caught, ""she had never seen a better looking man in person in her entire life."" That really is just clunky writing. And then there's, ""she regarded him with a small amount of fear lurking in her eyes"". An amount of something cannot lurk. Fear can lurk in her eyes sure, but an ""amount""?  The English language just doesn't work that way. This is what a decent editor should have picked up on and polished with the author.Also a little more attention to word choice is necessary, ""I'm sure just being here with you will cause Mehen to wale on (me)."" Wale is a horizontal wooden strip for a boat, according to the dictionary. The right homophone is ""wail"", spelt just like the sound. This isn't being picky - if you're going to ""publish"" then you need to do it right.Add to that the clunky plot development and inability to  handle the many characters in the story and you have a book that is a bit of a mess.

Yes, they can keep out the emotional attachments but they still get excited over the woman they are with (they kind of have to). I hate thinking that another woman can so easily take the place of the heroines in these stories. Who cares that there is not emotion in the hero's couplings, he still thinks about how many women he went through and how they dressed sexily when the heroine was wearing comfortable clothes, and let us not forget the thought of how his past women were willing to do explicit things to him!! That was gross and unneeded for the story! I actually started out liking him in the first chapter before it skipped ahead 8 years and to a completely different guy and a douchebag to boot!

2665,B004GKMPQW,"[11, 13]",1,"This is the story of a detective and his new partner encountering a murder case.  The case becomes something much more than solving a basic murder when details come to light regarding people related to murder victim.  And it becomes an issue of solving more than one case and adding assistance from FBI and Navy.  The premise, while not a new one, has merit.  The specifics are predictible in some parts and there are no real twists to getting to the ""who done it"" and why.  However, that does not mean that many will not enjoy this version.  For many will.  Fans of true suspense crime novels won't find real depth found in other noted authors of same genre (Robb, Grafton, Etc.) - but is a fairly good attempt.The issues lie with presentation (style) moreso than premise.  The novella is riddled with errors related to grammar, punctuation, character development and presence, Point of View, and story arc development.Punctuation:  overuse of exhuberance (!) where illfiting at times, extra floating dialogue quotes at end of paragraph without dialogue, other than dialogue bits (some, not all) incorrectly punctuated, some dialogue missing punctuation related to tags, missing or incorrect punctuation.  Dialogue paragraphs with same speaker punctuated incorrectly (though very few will know such.)Formatting is still a bit of an issue as there are some pages where paragraph breaks are so many only two small paragraphs fit on page.  I do not include format issues in star rating as I know that (at times) formatting is amazon conversion issue from downloaning - rather than writer issue.  However, it appears as if the manuscript was originally typed double spaced and when hitting double return between paragraph breaks (which would then be 4 lines, rather than customary 2) there was an overabundance of spaces.  If that is case a simple full document conversion to single spacing prior to downloading should clear up format issues like that.Grammar:  wrong words used - corn rolls (should be rows) to describe ME hair, make on (should be one) take - there are several such errors - but you get the idea on that.  Past tense and present tense switches in sentences and paragraphs was frequent.  Some may be stylistic choice of writer and happens - but not with such frequency as seen in the work.  Some subject/verbs were not grammatically correct - plural nouns get plural verbs,  etc.POV:  I origionally was going to forgive the first few POV switches as character related fleshing.  But, when the POV for many of the characters switched between third person and first person (in same paragraph) I realized it was author error, NOT character voice.  It is possible to have a character think to self in first while rest of tale told in third - but only if the writer understands the fine line and can convey properly.  In this installment of series (in author defense this is first in series and she may have worked this issue out in later works) the author has no grasp of what POV she is using and how to use properly.  One POV is best for the whole work until such time as skill is developed well enough that conveyance and reading are not stilted for reader.Character issues:  Trace was intergral character and partner in training,  then he just (all but) disappeared about half way through book in order for the ""love"" plot device to develop.  Bob was FBI partner that was there for a blink, disappeared for the same reason as Trace, then popped in near end without adding ANYTHING to storyline.  It would have served better to leave Bob out and just send 1 FBI agent to work case as Bob did nothing but add an inconsistency to story line (detail on that next) .  Press was well developed and Trace fairly so (even though underused)  as was female agent.Inconsistencies:Chapter 11 - Press and Trace left interview with Moira - they climbed in the beater car and drove away...fine, until the reader turns the page and Press puts key in ignition, turns it and gets the smoke plume.Chapter 27 - title states day 4 time:  10 AM - yet the first paragraph has press and agent arriving at house ""that evening.""Chapter 28 - title states day 5 at 9:15 AM - Bob tells Rachel he will be in that night and see her next morning.  However,  he does not show up until day 7, several chapters later.There were more issues related to each listed, but you get idea.  I apologize for length, I write long - though typically not thus much.  However, I viewed a comment by author wherein she stated that a review was not really fair to those reading it (or to her I surmise) without specifics so she could fix errors.  Though some of the word issues and punctuation are not a big deal and frequqntly missed - the gross errors (POV and story arc inconsistencies) should not require reviewer intervention for correction. They should have been caught by writer or her editor as they are glaring.As stated in beginning, many will enjoy this novella. Though predictible and even with errors it is an okay read.  If there were not so many errors, I would have awarded more stars.Christine","07 1, 2012",A30YDY4XKVUBUY,Christine Staeven,1341100800

I was a little worried, having read the 2 star review, but I figured the several five star reviews outweighed it.I wish I'd listened to the 2 star reviewer (who I think was a little nicer than she should have been).This book was awful. Horrible. Disgusting. Upsetting. I cannot find a single redeeming factor to the entire thing.  Here's why I hated it, why I'm fired up about reviewing it, and why I will never, ever, never, ever again read anything by this author.- The h is meek, mild, picked on, mistreated - and she just keeps going back for more. Over and over again, people, including the H, are downright cruel to her. I expected there to be some discovery or journey that leads the h to believe that she is worthwhile and has grown from the experiences she's lived through. That never happens. The book ends and she's still feeling sorry for herself and her life is utter crap.- The H is a complete jerk. He never redeems himself, and he never even makes a full effort to redeem himself. He sleeps with his WIFE after sleeping with the h, then repeatedly chooses his wife again and again (a woman who is cruel and insane) over the h. He simply tells the h 'sorry' and she instantly forgives him and the go on their merry way until the wife comes back a few pages later and the H runs to her.- There is very little lead up to the resolution (and it's a half resolution at that). The h ends up with a man, but it feels like she's more ending up with whatever leftovers are there, than that she's getting a HEA.- The h never stands up for herself and in fact, never even addresses some serious betrayals by her best friend/roommate, who told all of her private information to the crazy stalker wife of the H.It sickens me that I paid good money for this book. I finished only because I kept hoping that it would somehow get better. It makes me leery to try new authors when this is the kind of utter crap that I end up with.

It didn't make me throw my e-reader against the wall, but I strongly do not recommend it.  Here's why:-The plot is extraordinarily weak, so much so that I felt nothing really happens in the book!  I could sum things up in 2 sentences at most, but won't for spoilers' sake.  This book was so predictable that it was almost insulting.  I scanned many pages in this book.-The H/h had no ""character"".  The Hero was 32 yrs old and had done nothing with his life.  He hadn't served in the military or taken his seat in the House of Lords.  After reading other books where the main men did those things or at least had some sort of accomplishments, I did not like this Hero, Adam.  He seemed lazy and lust-driven to me.  Literally, all  he did in the book was have sex with the heroine and fall in love with her.  All the action to resolve any ""conflicts"" was done by others or conveniently by chance.  About all I know about him was he was a devastatingly handsome and disgustingly rich earl who desperately wanted to bed the heroine.  That's it.-The heroine was beautiful, which is beaten into your head over and over.  She was in a bad situation.  I was a bit disappointed in some of her choices.  She seemed kind of weak.  There wasn't much to her other than her looks.-The story is basically about adultery.  Yeah, it happens now and did then, but I couldn't wholeheartedly cheer this relationship on.  And for the heroine to fall into it so easily did not sit well with me.  That seemed a bit non-Regency to me.  I was convinced of their lust for each other, but not really the love.I guess you could also say the book was about love conquering all, but it does not conquer a weak and predictable plot and one-dimensional characters.","08 4, 2011",A2T42YB7IGE7US,"A.

For some reason, I thought the name of this book's author was ""Chula Stone"" (that is even how it appears on my Kindle).  While this is very different in tone that the previous two books I've read by the author, I wouldn't say it is better.  In fact, in very significant ways, it is much, much worse.Lyra Seville is a young woman who just got her Master's Degree in Parapsychology (from Duke University, and I'm sure they'd be thrilled to know they were dragged into this whole mess).  Lyra is an adult and she is supposed to be of reasonable intelligence, but she still can't figure out how to get the money left to her by her parents from her aunt/adoptive mother (her aunt adopted her after her parents died).  Despite the fact that their relationship is clearly explained at the beginning of the book, Lexi will be referred to as Lyra's ""stepmother"" for most of her subsequent appearences.Lyra is a beautiful dark-haired/blonde woman (Stone can't make up her mind) who has just never found love.  Somehow she got all the way through high school, college, and graduate school without ever feeling the urge, so she's a virgin.  Her friend encourages her to go out and see a handsome magician at a local nightspot and BAM -- she falls in instant lust.Meanwhile, there is a crazy kill-rape cult kidnapping women and killing them.  Pages and pages and pages pass and it becomes clear that Nick, her handsome magician beau, may not be what he seems and Lyra is the target of the kill-rape cult.  Her virginity is of prime importance to them, leading to a bizarre scene where she is finger-violated in the woods and the doctor checking her out helpfully lets us know that she is still intact.  Plus, he adds, ""I'd bet my stethoscope"" that the kind of lube used on the assailant's glove was the same used at the hospital . . . based on the SMELL.  How exactly did that examination go again?  And why is that even an important detail (trust me, the case isn't cracked based on lube brand).Nick's old friend Detective Michael Santera gets involved and suddenly our virginal heroine has another love interest.  Also, Lyra inherits a house from a dead magician, so they move into that to hide from the bad guys.  The story goes on and on and on and on.  Lots of women get raped and killed, Lyra visits a farm, an old diary provides classically clunky exposition, there is a flashback to a murder onboard a ship that doesn't really fit at all, an evil count shows up, and Lyra has to use every brain cell in her brunette/blonde head to survive.The book is easily 100-200 pages too long for the weight of the story that it has to tell.  Lyra and her friend spent a couple of weeks hiding and the story just drags.  The story is driven by the discovery of the diary and spirit guides, truly lazy storytelling.  The main bad guy, ""the Adversary,"" is given an entire clunky backstory that barely stands up.  Once you finish the book and realize who is actually good and who is actually evil, virtually every character has done things that make zero sense.  The characters act as if their presumed motivation is their real one, but once their real allegances are known, so much of what they have done no longer makes sense.  There is an overreliance on viceral responses to provoke engagement from the reader, but there are only so many times you can read about a dead woman, never in the story, being found with stuff cut off of her, before you don't care at all.To top it all off, the editing is w-r-e-t-c-h-e-d.  The books I have previously read by Stone didn't have this issue.  It seems as if it wasn't proofed at all and there are multiple places with some sort of formatting issue that causes a single name to be repeated for a line or more.Bottom line:  this book is too long, the plot is terrible, and there is no attention to detail.  Even if you get it for free, your time is worth something, right?","05 26, 2013",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,1369526400

Where's the heroines father is one of the main plot points and yet she asks almost no one this reasonable question.

I'm mad or upset in some way but I will not say a thing, we'll go for a walk, we'll have some stupid conversation that is about nothing, I will fall down on top of one of the other characters, it's just too stupid to be suffered through.  Everyone knows that the heroine has some kind of ""powers"" but she hasn't a clue and NEVER finds out anything about them.  The hero is so all consumed with some angst that he can not say a single thing to the heroine that is not sarcastic and snarky and she is so stupid she can only say to herself well he's an ass but to him she either says nothing or something snappy like Hmpff.  Let's not forget to mention that she falls down every other scene if not every scene.  I have not read anything so awful since a few years ago when I picked up a so called romance where in the first chapter the dashing hero brutally rapes the heroine.

I was very intrigued by the first couple of chapters, but as the story wore on, my interest and patience flagged.This book introduces Preston 'Press' Andrews.  After the initial engaging description of the crime and its perpetrator, we are led into 'timeline' chapters.  By chapter 14 we are not even 12 hours removed from the beginning of Preston's part of the story, but we have been 'treated' to agonizing and saccharine descriptions of this apparent super hero/detective, and yet very little about the actual crime investigation.  We know how tall Preston is and how much he weighs, the color of his eyes and hair, how muscular he is, how he dresses in Armani apparel and Italian leather loafers, how wealthy he is, how amazing he is...but still humble, how his nickname around the precinct is 'Super Dick' (tee-hee!) because he can solve ANY crime, how beautiful his sister is, how she has long, long legs, about her bra-less breasts (these points noticed by Preston himself...ewwwww), and pretty much how superior Detective Andrews is to all the mere mortals around him.We also get to know a tiny bit about Preston's new partner, Trace Evans ('Press' and Trace...those are not names, they are verbs).  Trace is a new detective, but is treated like a fresh out of the academy rookie beat cop.  Preston looks for signs that Trace is going to be sick at the sight of the victim's body.  Although I am far from an expert on police matters, I was under the impression that it takes a while to work up to being a detective, and by the time a police officer has achieved this designation they have probably already seen their fair share of gruesome sights.  Apparently this is not so in Trace's case.  It seems it is up to Preston to take young Evans under his wing and show him the ABC's of police work, while simultaneously looking like a GQ model, comforting all the rich people in town, making amends with (and surreptitiously leering at) his sister, navigating an amicable break up with his girlfriend (amicable in large part due to how fabulous 'Press' is), and finally, getting the upper hand in an ongoing feud with the big, bad meany Motor Pool officer in charge (insert dramatic music here).Does this sound tedious?  If so, imagine slogging through this mire the entire first half of the book.That's as far as I got.  I deleted this from my device at 54% as I surmised that a great deal more of the text would likely deal with the author's worship of her protagonist rather than the exploration of who committed the crime and why.

10409,B004KA9JDK,"[14, 16]",1,"I was going to send a message to the author and tell him I just can't review this book. Then, I went and read the reviews at Goodreads and Amazon (etc.) and I decided some balance was required. Whenever I read a book like this and I read reviews that are not only positive, but have praise specifically for the very things I find worst about the book - I always wonder if they're friends of the author, alternate identities of the author, or people with really low standards in their reading selection.I was 10% into this book and struggling to read further. I made it as far as 27% when I gave up. I just can't force myself to read something this awful. And while I'd really like to get to the surprise ending the other readers have hinted at, I just can't force myself to read any further to get to the big reveal.My first problem is the characters. They're like cartoon characters, the women more than the men. They simply aren't believable. I didn't like any of them and I couldn't relate to any of them. I'm all for damaged characters if their damage makes them interesting, but these characters were so cartoonish they were nothing more than tiresome. I also kept asking myself why this story was populated with the details of characters who seemed to have no impact on the story and do nothing to move the story along. It was difficult enough to maintain an interest in the primary cast of characters without getting distracted by the minor, or even unnecessary, characters.Contributing to the inability to relate to the characters is the second major problem: the dialogue. It's stilted and doesn't flow. Even if the author hadn't told me English was not his first language, I would've guessed. The syntax of the entire book is off, but it's most evident in the dialogue. It's difficult (painful, even) to read.The third problem is the setting. I've been to Medford, OR. I have friends who live in Medford, OR. I don't recognize Medford in this story. I have also worked in hospitals and worked with doctors for over 20 years. The hospital setting and situations were not believable to me. At least when ""House, MD"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" wander far from reality, the characters are interesting and what they're doing is interesting. The same is not true in ""Promise Me Eternity."" Every time the author took the doctor on detailed rounds, including a description of the patient and what the patient was doing and the conversation with the patient, I kept wondering ""what the hell does this have to do with the story?"" Unless you're a doctor, rounds are boring. And unless a patient is going to play a part in what's going to happen later in the story, the reader doesn't need to know what they look like, what they're doing in the hospital and what they said to the doctor during rounds. Acknowledging that I didn't finish the book, so I don't know whether or not these patients figure later in the story, I can't imagine that every patient in every round is going to play an important part in the whole story.All in all, I was grateful I didn't pay for this book. Even at $0.99, it's not worth it and it's definitely not worth the time.","03 3, 2012",A3GSOAYP4XES3L,"J. Weight ""juliew8""",1330732800

Lets face it, anyone who picks up this story isn't looking for a language lesson and some of the terminology used takes the sincerity out of the book.

Not that there was  anything funny about this book, it just seemed like a poor attempt at writing a book about this topic from the author's part.  Perhaps as p as the author was trying to write a book about Norman conqueror's that was not the usual norman conqueror children as characteristics, and if that was the case, she failed miserably because norman conqueror's usually consummate the marriage ASAP after they are wed to the vanquished bride so that they have greater claim to the land.  But this norman hero seems to suffer from some ridiculous mental flaw, that he does the contrary, only because he wants her to care for  him first.  That's fine if  this this was a typical medeival romance book, but this is a norman conqueror who was given this land and bride as conquest.  This story was totally unrealistic for this era and I was really disappointed with this read.

800,B004FN2DGW,"[2, 3]",1,"Ok, let me start with the statement that I love ghost stories, LOVE 'em.  I am also not someone who throws a book down in disgust and doesn't finish it. I finished this book...read every stinkin' word, first with interest, then in puzzlement, progressing to disbelief.  My thoughts are as follows:1.  Not one, not two, but EVERY character in this story behaves in a completely unbelievable fashion (oh the little kid almost gets hit by a car then disappears into the cemetery, gosh, maybe we ought to look then call the police tomorrow if we don't see her, but ...gosh.. totally forgot about that.2.  There is no consistency between characters and scenes. None...at...all3.  Story lines are started, then completely dropped, with an entirely different plotline popping up.  Kind of like flipping channels on a tv, but with the same actors on screen...mostly.4.  If you are going to write about cemeteries, go to one.  Coffins do not litter the ground; those are called headstones or monuments.  Coffins are buried fairly deep, like 6 feet or so, not just under the topsoil.  The newly dead are embalmed and jaw shut before the burial, which usually takes more than..oh say 12 hours after she died on a plane...in another jurisdiction.  Oh,  and the puritans of the Salem witch trial era did not use mausoleums, particularly not for a victim of the witch trials, nor would you be able to just pop that coffin open and take a look.5.  If you are going to write about victims of the Salem witch trials, do some research beyond grabbing their names. i.e. their remains were not chained together and ""lost,"" they didn't all die the same way or in the same week. These were real people and an historical tragic event.  Either treat it with a little respect and research or make up an entirely different event.6.  Don't have the court say one thing, then act like the witch trials themselves, but have no development of that before sending minors to jail with no charges, but, hey, cell bars can't hold these girls anyway, huh?7.  Don't rip off Norman Bates and put him in a witch hat. Just don't.8.  Ok, minor point.  The plane ride from Vermont to Boston is not a long trip to the point of exhaustion for a teenager unless they got routed through dfw, but in your story it is one flight, you know, where the old woman with the portent of doom died.9.  Use a thesaurus.  Look up ""bragged,"" pick a synonym.  Repeat process for other words.10.  Oh, cell phones do work across state lines, and when the kid is trapped with a psycho killer, roaming charge be d***d. The state line thing was a recurring factor, thus a recurring irritant.  The phone would work, as would 911.When I started this story, it was with the attitude that this will be a fun YA ghost story; then I decided that it must have been written BY a kid, so don't be cruel or snarky.  After reading the blurb after the ending that the author is a columnist who has been published in several outlets, I decided to write this, my first negative review.  I usually just forget about it if I hate a book, never understanding people giving bitterly negative reviews to a free book; but this story is just badly written and badly researched (yes, you should do some research, even for YA fiction, maybe even, ESPECIALLY for YA fiction.)  Some of the free-form ""plotting"" could have been developed into a decent story - there were glimpses of what could be - but it just didn't happen. If your kids (or you) enjoyed this story, just understand that there are infinitely better ones out there, some that even have some accuracy about Salem and the witch trial, and, frankly, some that even make some sort of sense. Loosely tying together some creepy imagery does not make a story.","05 9, 2012",A2J9GU1HUC700S,B. B CLEMMER,1336521600

7255,B004N62M26,"[22, 35]",1,"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 in a sci-fi erotica series set in Earth's relatively near future. This book shows no respect for women whatsoever. While there were definitely some very hot scenes, this was an irritating story. It was very well written, but it was well written garbage. Unfortunately, the ENTIRE plot sequence was based on the inability of the main characters to have an adult conversation. Every single thing that went wrong could have been avoided if they sat down and TALKED. And I was unable to enjoy the fabulous sex scenes because it basically amounted to rape: NO MEANS NO, even if there are pheromones involved that cause unwanted arousal. I just wanted to cry every time they started fooling around because all I could think of was how desperately Olivia DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM.CHARACTERS: Told from both characters' first person perspective, we got to know them both pretty well. One saving grace to this story is that Baird, the male lead, was actually a very sympathetic character when I was reading his perspective- even if he was an arrogant idiot- but from her perspective, he was awful. I really wanted to like him, but his complete inability to respect Olivia's wishes and talk to her like an adult just made me want to beat the crap out of him. Olivia was also almost likeable, except that she was also unable to just address things head on with Baird. One example: Baird decided to FORBID Olivia from leaving the room, rather than just bloody explaining to her the dangers of going out without him, and Olivia just acted sarcastic and rebellious instead of bothering to ASK WHY. For goodness sakes, people, Darwin's Law applies here.PLOT: Decent enough set up for a sci-fi erotica and would have made for a fantastic story if it had been handled differently. Instead of two rational adults- who could have acknowledged their attraction and then tried to find a way to make it work- we ended up with selfish, immature fools who spent their time fighting and alternately lying to each other and teasing each other. Also, there was absolutely NO ROOM made in the plot for Baird to make any compromises to accommodate Olivia- it was all about Olivia sacrificing her entire life for him. He was just supposed to convince her it was a good idea. Yeah- I guess the concept women's liberation never made it into our future.BOTTOM LINE: This was infuriating at best and offensive at worst. In fact, I'd call this book a travesty mainly because the author clearly has serious writing talent. The writing itself was very well done- the sex was very erotic, the characters very sympathetic- but because the actions and events were based on STUPIDITY it just made it painful to read. If you're the kind of person who likes a story about a woman who finds a man who is willing to worship her physically and you're not worried about whether she manages to maintain her own life, then you might like this. But if you're the kind of person who thinks keeping a woman locked up in the bedroom for the rest of her life is offensive, avoid this like the plague.","04 3, 2011",AQNXEOJ4RPCGW,A.

While I'm sure they're all very nice people, they are not experienced in helping a story achieve cohesion. They also don't want to hurt your feelings.This book suffers from a lack of good, critical feedback.

The author describes four unrelated characters as having flame red hair and emerald eyes. That's a lot of freaking redheads with. Cliched green eyes, which are just not that common.There's an issue with the heroine initially being attracted to virtually every man she meets, so her insta-love with yet another man had little impact.Style wise, the plethora of choppy short sentences beginning with &#34;I&#34; just grated. I did this, I did that. &#34;I walked to the door. He stood at the door. I went through the door. He followed me.&#34; Then a giant info-dump. Rinse and repeat.

Now, after having resigned himself to not finding her, after debating the final sleep and turning further and further away from existence, he steps on a girls toes and his entire world changes.Lissa was feeling apprehensive about taking the shuttle bus up the mountain, but she got on anyway. Slightly psychic, she's feeling very uneasy until she sees a man who literally robs her of breath and makes her heart race. Suddenly those psychic warnings are blaring conflicting messages and when he trods on her toes and looks into her eyes, Lissa knows she'll remember that fantastic stranger for the rest of her days.A tragedy leads them to each other and dedication to each other will see them through to eternity.It's not the premise to this short novella that I have a problem with. It's perhaps not the most original of stories, but it has a bunch of sexy male vampires in it, and that's pretty much all I need to enjoy a short story like this. Unfortunately, it was just about every other aspect of the story that made me wince.I think D'Arc had some sizzling sex scenes in the book that are deliciously graphic and temperature raising, but that's where the good points end. The dialogue is so unbelievable, so cliched and trite and way beyond soap opera-ish that it actually hurt to read some of it. I totally don't get it. I've read D'Arc before and didn't have that problem with the book, but this one was quite literally painful.The development (and I use the term loosely) of the relationship between Atticus and Lissa was nearly comical in its speed and lack of anything resembling realism, and the 'conflict' of the story arc was...just bizarre. If that wasn't bad enough, it ends with a cliffhanger, and I have a huge issue with cliffhangers. They're in my top three of reading anathemas. At this point not even a life threatening cliffhanger could prompt me to continue with this series, though I did like the interaction between Atticus' friend Marc and Lissa's friend Kelly.

(spoiler alert)  so in the 2nd story when she finally thinks they really care for her they trick her into getting pregnant and she leaves. they follow her and because the bad guys also follow and she fights them after she protects herself and her baby, remi and dane are furious with her and end up spending the nite with 2 women from the feline pack that lives there.  when she comes down from the loft they are rubbing themselves all over remi and dane, who just look at her.  they drag her back to their pack and even when they find out remi's baby was never in danger they are still mad at her and give her the cold shoulder. now this is where i really hated this book, after hurting jaycee time and time and time again, in front of the pack home 2 of the pack females come up to dane and remi and rub themselves all over them with jaycee standing right there.  then they say that they heard dane and remi had spent the nite with 2 other women when they were gone. (i couldn't help but wonder how they had heard that unless dane or remi told the pack) and offered their services for that nite. dane and remi turn and look at jaycee who says she would like them to spend the nite with her, but it is their choice.  then she goes to their room and prepares herself for them and puts candles all over the room.  she falls asleep and wakes up hours later with the candles all burned out and no mates. she puts on a robe cuz she has on a very revealing teddy with strategic cut outs that remi had gotten her before all this had happened, and goes down the stairs to the kitchen.  on the kitchen table are two naked women, with dane and remi's face buried in their nether regions.  they look up and see jaycee devasted and realize she had expected them to spend the nite with her and that THEY HAVE GONE TOO FAR.  PLEASE, HOW CAN THEY EVEN DO THAT TO THEIR MATE? then the story goes on about how they feel so bad that they hurt her so much.  but of course after groveling for two seconds she takes them back again.  i have never read a shape-shifter story, wolf or otherwise, that treated a mate in this manner. i love menage shifter stories, but i hated this one. the 2 stories were filled with pain and cruelity. some of the reviews for the 1st part of the story said how hot the sex was-how can it be hot when they treat their mate like she is just a convient body to get their rocks off on when they are not mad at her?  amazon should pull this story and the 1st part also. don't waste your money on it. i certainly won't be buying anymore of her books.","01 3, 2011",A1YVDKMJY8A76P,chris s weill,1294012800

There's an over abundance of repetition, both in content and words (pu$$y, no, bred/breeding, essence, no, virgin barrier, beast/monster, no, c@nt, no, no...).2. World building is lacking, the MC's are supposedly not human (and the last of their species) but very little information is given...and what little we learn is not a plus (squicky courtship rituals and child sex).3. Back to the child sex elements.  Call it fantasy/dreams/alien norm, it's still disgusting.  I'm sorry, but there's no way to pretty this up and make it acceptable or attractive...but the author kept attempting to beat that dead horse.4. The Heroine. The reader is provided enough fodder to write essay on the many ways this heroine is not likeable.  By the 1/3 mark I had an overwhelming urge to just slap the brat, and by the 2/3 mark I'm actively rooting for the heroine to die so the hunky hero can move on and get himself a real woman. Her only attractive qualities are physical, and the poor hero is doomed to a lifetime if misery bonded to this neurotic, indecisive, self-centered, potentially psychotic, twit.5. ""C@ck Tease"" - Yet another unlikable heroine characteristic. This term was mentally flashing above my head in bright neon colors almost the entire time I was reading (eventually skimming) this book.6. Non-consent/rape elements mentioned in other reviews? Not really how I would describe it (see item #5).  There's a number of sexual situations where the heroine says no, the hero pressures for further intimacy, she says no again (and obviously doesn't mean it and encourages him again), more pressure, and she capitulates.  I think the author may have been aiming for a borderline non-consensual feel, but it fell flat.  And personally I found it all more annoying than titillating, but other readers may feel otherwise.7. Incest...where?  The MC's lived together for a few years as adopted siblings, over 17 years ago.  No blood relationship whatsoever, and given the time frame involved this didn't trip my personal incest squick.8. At least two elements I felt were given too much emphasis (bordering on OCD) were her virginity and the brother/sister relationship.  Heroine wrestled with this almost every page...ad nausium.8. There is sex in werewolf form, it you find this offensive...just another reason to avoid this book.9. The fiance...what to say?  This entire aspect of the story just didn't work for me.  Why was she engaged to this guy, why did he put up with her, she didn't plan any portion of her own wedding, she ended it very badly and he morphs into a sex criminal...WTF.Bottom line...my urges to slap the heroine were multitude.","08 17, 2012",A1Y85K3I2CNXAF,"Denni ""bookworm""",1345161600

I get the tendency that some authors have to fall back on the 'you're my mate, so we're instantly in love/lust' plotline, but I hated the way it was handled in this book.Neil and Ryan had spent many years as sex slaves, with the physical, mental and emotional trauma that entails.  I've seen authors handle this type of situation in a realistic, sensitive manner, but it is barely even addressed in this book before the main characters begin a physical relationship. Instead, the author would have us believe that all of that just disappeared when they met Gabe, because of the mating bond. The author had them willing and even eager to jump into bed with Gabe within 24 hours of meeting him, even though he was a large intimidating man similar to the men who held them, the men they were apparently terrified of.I consider this a cop out, using the instant love, instant trust 'mating bond' because an author is too lazy to, or incapable of actually addressing the deeper issues involved in the aftermath of abuse.

The first chapter takes place at work and Lena literally doesn't work for the rest of the book.  The world of work presented here isn't realistic either.  It just doesn't make sense that five college friends, all in their twenties, would be able to set up a super successful Hollywood production company - especially when they rely on their receptionist to set up meetings for them and he does it on the basis of whether or not the guys are cute.  This is far from a minor detail in the book - Lena's job is supposedly how she meets the male main character in the first place.It was disturbing how quickly Lena adopted Luke as a ""pet,"" buying him clothes, telling people to keep their hands off of him, being charmed by his failure to understand human society (and while we're at it, why bother to create a whole new class of beings for your books but then stick with the whole ""he doesn't really understand humans/good sex mates him for life/he is violently possessive"" thing that plagues most PNRs?), and telling her friends (in front of him!) very specific details about how good he is in bed.  I'm so sick of the message that all every woman of minimal accomplishment wants is a guy who will be willing to have slightly deviant sex with her while being so turned on by her that he'll feel compelled to rape her when he even imagines her with another man (which, yes, actually happens here).  While this might not work with an actual woman, Lena is a bit more one-dimensional.  She's sassy!  She's been hurt by men!  She's always on a diet!  She likes mochas!  Her living room is decorated with high heeled shoes and knick knacks from Anthropologie!  She's presumably JUST LIKE YOU or JUST LIKE YOU WOULD WANT TO BE, all she needs is a monster to make her complete (and maybe rape her on the couch!)The plot doesn't really exist other than the sex - there's a flimsy and easily resolved conflict and the rest of the time is spent setting up Lena's beautiful and super cool friends to star in future books.  They're women of accomplishment also, so it should be no time before they realize that their entire life was worthless until they met a macho monster to dominate them.","07 20, 2011",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,1311120000

3416,B004CJ810Q,"[29, 31]",1,"(Spoiler Alert) Ten years ago the h caught the H in bed with her best friend.  Because of this, the h leaves town and starts a singing career.  After becoming a huge success as a country singer, she returns to her home town and comes face to face with the H and his daughter.  They greet each other and act as though they were good friend separated by distance and time, not a huge betrayal.  As a reader you rationalize that the child was there and so were other people so maybe that was why the lack of emotion but this same lack of anger continues throughout the book.  When they meet again, the H informs the h that he had actually ended up marrying the OW but she died a few years back.  The h then cries about what an awful friend she was for not being there for her best friend and how sorry she was that she was dead and unable to apologize to her for all the hurtful things that she had said to her.  WHAT?!!!  So...the best friend sleeps with the H and the h is apologizing?The story continues pretty much with the same tone.  IMO, the H did nothing to win the h back or to build trust again, it just happens as though it was a given: the h will take the H back.  The reconciliation was too easy and the H was completely unimpressive.  All his actions spoke of a man with little passion or action.  For example, the h sees him in bed with her best friend but he won't go after her because he believes she should go.  He thought that the OW might have been lying about the paternity of the baby after they had sex but he marries her anyway.  The OW had a miscarriage, the reason he married her, but he stays married.  This H sucks!Worse of all, the entire story they kept talking about the OW as though she was not a huge source of betrayal among them.  Things like ""your house is beautiful, she must have really loved it"" and while skating mentioning how the OW went skating with the daughter all the time or what a wonderful mother the OW was.The comment that the h said to the H mom towards the end of the book pretty much sums up the book : ""I should have stayed and fought for him.""  Really?  Because in my book I would fight to get rid of a man who would sleep with my best friend, made no effort to make amends and then complained about how hard HIS life was because everyone knew he cheated on her.

Just as an example, the death of two people who are discovered in a crash train car are proclaimed as ""not accidental"" by the police - what gave it away, the multiple stab wounds or the fact that the bodies were already in rigor and the train car just crashed.  A monopoly on world food supplies by controlling the seeds - anyone ever hear of Burpees.The whole opening scene consists of our ""hero"" chasing after a runaway train car (to do what we have no idea since it's a 70 ton runaway) and causes several traffic accidents that kill innocent people and we're somehow supposed to overlook that because he had a higher purpose in somehow warning the town of the runaway car.  It made absolutely no sense to me and even the crash scene is so exaggerated as to be unbelievable (do you really think a fully loaded boxcar is going to slide that far on it's ride after coming off the rails - come on).The story line was weak, the characters shallow and not particularly likeable and the protagonist can seemingly kill at will without getting caught.  This is the one of the few times I bought a Kindle version of a book without downloading a sample first because of all the positive reviews.  Wish I'd saved the $3.00 as the sample would have taken me far enough into the book to realize this just isn't a good book.My apologies to all those that read and absolutely raved about this book.

What a promising premise, unfortunately Clark doesn't deliver on the promise.The beginning of the story is strong as Clark pairs up a grizzled street cop and a FBI profiler. They are exact opposites so the reader is set-up for the personality conflicts that will undoubtedly arise as the duo pursues the serial killer but these conflicts never happen because Clark regulates the street cop to the background of the story soon after the beginning. The whole story takes a nose dive at this point.As the story continues the reader has to constantly battle to suspend disbelief. For example, a brother and sister who both happen to be FBI agents stationed in the Washington D.C. area. A stretch at best but I'm willing to make it to stay in the story. However, Clark includes a famous country singer for a love interest who happens to have an uncle who is ex-CIA, who will conveniently provide all the clandestine help necessary to solve the case. This pushed suspension of disbelief to the utmost limits.The corny characters were bearable but what wasn't bearable was the ending. Clark builds the story and prepares the reader for a great climatic battle between the serial killer and the protagonist only there is no battle, just revelation of the identity of the killer.First Kill All The Lawyers had the makings of a great yarn then it just fizzled.

This book is pointless, as the whole premise is flawed, based on a non-canon idea, and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars (which trump the C-Canon (soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon) ideas in Traviss' books.)Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying, uninteresting, boring, obnoxious, mary-sue characters ever written. She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett, and turned him into a character who just Wouldn't Shut Up. She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive, lost, dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy, into a clan of dancing, singing, Mando'a speaking, boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And don't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is. If you want to know every tiny, minuscule, stupid thing about a character, just turn to Traviss' books. You're lucky if she doesn't tell you how, when, and where Boba acquired his underwear, and what they're made of.Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of Traviss' work.

No matter how many times it is stressed that other naked guys do not turn you on you ARE gays or bisexual. If you are a gay guy it is my impression that maybe a person whom you are not attracted to does not have to turn you on, just as every guy does not have to turn me on as straight woman.Oh let's not forget the ""he has gay friends"" thing and how those gay friends according to one of them are TWINKS which is translated as effeminate men with swimmer physique, contrary to what our characters are.Oh I can go on and on.

Harper, the main character and her primary love interest, Jackson who both pushed me to prevail. However, their short-lived relationship was the only part of the novel that I had enjoyed, aside from the ending (since the book was finally over).Even with what I like about the two characters, they still had more than their fair share of flaws as I only favoured the two with a lack of a better option. Jackson incessantly refused to explain the situation to Harper, as also leaving me in the dark to what the actual conflict is. As for Harper, she was oblivious to her surroundings. This was especially frustrating as her ""amnesia"" caused her to forget the start of her relationship with Jackson, which was one of my highlights of the book. Not only did she develop ""mysterious"" amnesia, she immediately chose to conform to society as a cheerleader, something which she previously claimed had no appeal when it was out of her reach. The other supporting roles were also incapable of peaking my interest, such as Harper's closest friend, Agnes and her ""shocking"" secrets and sealed fate.Cannon only succeeded in writing a story centred upon a quintessential high school hierarchy and a self-absorbed sophomore who is incapable of staying conscious for more than a couple of days. Personally, this does not suit my taste, in spite of the regular action and romance that I often find appealing. Only if this sounds intriguing to other readers would I recommend this novel, because in the least, Cannon' s writing style was not as shocking as what plot points consisted in ""Beautiful Demons"".","01 26, 2013",A2Y1HTY9S8RR2Y,Stephanie,1359158400

2361,B002VFPSD6,"[2, 8]",1,"Welome to the negative review of the book everyone else loved.Let's begin shall we.I will start with the plot. When I was first reading the synopsis the plot sounded intriguing, and I loved the idea of the disgraced book hunter, and the lost Dickens story, but for some reason it ended up not working for me. I think that sex was introduced too early on, and was a distraction from what I liked about the idea of the book rather than something that added to the story.I liked James for the most part, and was able to sympathize with his plight. Losing the job he loved, and the security in his world must have been terrible, and, having worked retail, understand how frustrating, exhausting, and dehumanizing that can be. Added to the stress of trying to make ends meet on part time work without any sort of benefits, it's no wonder why he does what he does.Sedgwick, on the other hand, I never developed any affection for. I found him to be blunt to a point beyond simple rudeness, and his excuses seemed liked those of a child rather than a 42 year old man who should be old enough to understand proper behavior, or at least how to make a sincere apology for his words. I found his behavior, after he and James had a falling out, to be almost stalker like, and added to that he seems to almost bully James into hearing him out, and accepting his half hearted apology. He is also described as having a full beard, which is not my thing, and with all the scenes of both men eating had me truly grossed out imagining all the crumbs it must collect (this is not meant as a slight to any of my friends who have or enjoy beards, it's just not my thing.)For me the worst part of this book was the sex. This book had some of the hands down worst written sex scenes I've ever read, and let me tell you I have read some truly terrible sex scenes. Let's go to the book for some examples shall we.""Like a suede glove grabbing me, stroking me..Like a hot black fist.""What the hell is that supposed to mean, and why a black fist?""The pump and pull was like a hammer striking the golden frames of angel wings, pounding them into shining, glinting pennons. Perspiration sheened our bodies and our breath grew harsher as we bent our backs and worked the forge, and then the wings began to beat, trying to take flight, moving faster and faster, and we seemed to lift right off the ground, right off the pillows, and bedding, and hang there transfixed as warm, white Halle-fricking-lujah surged through.And then we dropped back to earth, wet, winded and weak. Human again.""Seriously what in the name of pink plastic ponies did I just read? I had to look up what a pennon was because I had no idea. Merriam-Webster was kind enough to tell me it ""a long usually triangular or swallow-tailed streamer typically attached to the head of a lance as an ensign"" which only made the sentence even more of a mystery to me because it sounded like the author was alluding to something that would be forged, like something made out of metal, say a sword, but the word he used meant something made of cloth. Color me confused. It's also some of the sappiest, most awkwardly written sex I've even read, and that's including the het 80's romance I read in high school. Nothing about this works for me on any level, and that's not the only angel reference during sex there is.""It was like landing on a cloud - with an angel on top of me. An angel that tasted like cinnamon and chocolate and stardust.""Really, exactly how old are these characters supposed to be because it sounds more like some child's fantasy of sex rather than real, adult sex. Sedgwick has some sort of whipped chocolate cr&egrave;me brulee body cream souffl&eacute; that only adds to my impression of them as much younger than they really are.My least favorite of the sex scenes has to be the one I included in my updates, but it bears repeating.""and it was sadly like a hood over the head of an angel, but better safe than sorry.The angel continued to blindly feel its way to the hot, candy-slick center hovering tentatively above it.There is nothing about that I find sexy, and ""candy-slick"" I guess I don't find candy to be very slick. I think of candy more as sticky which makes this analogy all that less appealing to me.In summary I will say I found the sappy, miracle ending to be the final straw. If things had been toned down quite a bit, and the characters' relationship allowed to develop at a more natural pace I might have enjoyed this book. Had the mystery of the Dickens story played a more significant role, and the sex scenes cut back I would have happily given this at least three stars. Alas this was not to be.","03 21, 2013",A30LBR2VOXBST7,"MLE ""Omnivorous reader""",1363824000

The reviews this story received peaked my interest and I decided to give this book a try.  What a disappointment!  The characters were so poorly developed that I had to make up my own vision of what the character Bobby looked like.  Kate is a young woman who is preparing to wed a rich, successful man that she obviously is not in love with, but, whom she feels will offer her security.  When she discovers him cheating on her, in their bed, at a ski vacation retreat she leaves him and promptly drives the car into a ditch.  Along comes Bobby and Cale, two former military guys who own a ranch together.  They pull her to safety and take her to bed to warm her.  As soon as she awakens, she decides they're hot, why not and gets it on with the two of them.  Their affair takes place over a week in which Kate falls in love with the two cowboys and they with her, although this has got to be the most unromantic affair I have ever read.  The plot to this story is so weak and thin as to be the most anorexic one I have ever suffered through.  I read many, many erotic books and this one does not deliver on any level.  I didn't care about the characters, I didn't believe their emotions and I was very glad I bought this title electronically.

4303,B004O0UA1Q,"[3, 6]",1,"**Possible Spoilers** If I had to review this book in one word it would be 'ridiculous'.  I had high hopes the first few pages as the initial crime unfolded.  I went into it willing to suspend belief about a model using that profession as a cover for her real job as a CIA agent.  When I read Jaclyn's back story about her parents and her near blindness I thought, ""Hmmm...this is intriguing.""Before too long though it became apparent that this book was going to fail due to cartoonish bag guys, silly superhero type gadgetry, and a plot whose holes you could fly a plane through.What could have been an interesting thriller was anything but.  The villain of the piece was presented immediately.  A mystery surrounding who murdered the 46 people with poisoned bottled water would have been engrossing.  Instead, super baddie, (and comically sociopathic) Grant Chillings is dumped into the reader's lap.I kept waiting for a clever explanation for his horrible deeds and how, exactly, he planned to gain the monopoly on the bottled beverage industry but it never materialized.  His end game was that he was going to add poison to his competitor's products and the local water supply, thereby forcing people to drink his bottled water or nothing at all.  He wasn't going to get caught or prosecuted for his crimes because he was justified in commiting them and the government wouldn't dare touch him.  I'm no expert, but I believe that narcissists feel justified in their actions, but they aren't patently stupid.When he murdered the entire Board of Directors of his company I was thinking, ""You don't think somebody might notice you did that?""Then we come to our heroine.  Again, this could have been a very interesting character, but failed miserably.  We are asked to believe that the government could only spare one inexperienced CIA agent and a 'watchdog' for her after 46 people die from poisoning and later 9 children are hospitalized in another attempt.  That's how the government would react to terrorism?When Agent 'Snapshot's' partner is eventually killed she is told by the director of the CIA that she'll have to 'go it alone' since they can't spare anybody else to help out with the investigation.  Riiiigggghhhht.The rest of this tale consists of Jaclyn running around in a skin tight black jumpsuit that is equipped with special spy toys, using her custom made spy Porche to wage war on Grant Chilling's laughable 'army' (in one of Boston's main government buildings, no less), and the female President of the United States using Boston's Duck Boats to storm the villain's lair.  If it sounds stupid that's because it is...painfully so.Also, the author's insistence on describing Jaclyn's profuse sweating as she runs around Boston in her spy suit and trenchcoat became sickening.One surprise bright side to this book was the unintentional comedic factor.  I found myself chuckling at several of the more absurd parts such as Jaclyn's mercurial response to different situations, which I can't imagine any self respecting CIA agent indulging in.  Also, the idea of government sanctioned destruction of city property (including missiles launched from Jaclyn's car) had me laughing and shaking my head.Most amusing were the spy toys Jaclyn had at her disposal.  The unfortunate part is that none of them really helped her.  With the exception of her body armor and the security system evading app for her iPad, the bad guys still kept getting the jump on her.For a woman who was trained to use all her senses in deference of her very poor eyesight and who was required to take out several Navy SEALS as a part of that training; she was amazingly inept at defending herself.I considered giving this book 2 stars because it had potential, but decided that it merited only one because of its blatant waste of a good story line.","03 10, 2012",AFAIEJL65GKRK,DeeDee Brown,1331337600

In their search for wives and families of their own, the Beasts have created a pathway between their world and Earth and proceeded to kidnap suitable brides.The plot could have been fine and the typos can be overlooked. The gradual adaptation of the women to a new world and the heroine falling in love could have made for a great story if it had been treated with subtlety.What irked me is the blatant sexism and homophobia that permeated the story. The brides have to be pure (meaning virgins), they are mostly very young (sixteen) and deemed old enough to marry men twice their age. They're kidnapped and kept prisoners until they agree to marry. Those who try to flee back to Earth are punished (worse, the author even makes them like their punishment). There are many references to the fact that the men must be dominant and the women trained to obey and follow. Once kissed, they seem to loose what little reason they were born with and are enthralled with their kidnappers. The only things they require to stay are a) clothes and nice apartments and b)marriage and the wedding night.Homosexual practices are deemed against nature and disgusting.Now, I understand that this might be the view of some readers and I respect that the author has the right to her own beliefs. Unfortunately, it goes against my own beliefs of equality between the sexes and acceptance of all mankind, even those with different taste in their bedroom partners.

11782,B0040GJ6N2,"[7, 9]",1,"***SPOILERS*** Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 in a mind-numbingly uninspired paranormal romance about Polar bear shifters. Surprisingly bland and lackluster, despite the beautiful setting. Writing clear and accessible, but dialogue falls flat. I would have imagined that it would be nearly impossible to take a gorgeous Alaskan wilderness cabin fever story and ruin it, but that's what happened here. Only redeeming quality: it took barely two hours to read it, so I didn't waste much time.MAIN ISSUE: Complete lack of tension, conflict or plot. From the first moment Carson slips naked into the bed of a sleeping Ruby- before even introducing himself- to the very end, there was no conflict at all. The closest this story ever comes to conflict is the remarkably nave Ruby hesitating over living out in the middle of nowhere. In the end there is a pathetic attempt at compromise over this issue where Carson agrees to go to Chicago, but then the book ends thereby eliminating any idea that this would have caused conflict and you are left to assume that he does, they have a good time, but ultimately decide to go back to Alaska where they belong and live happily ever after.There were a few places this story could have found a real plot:1. Ruby could have resisted. Instead she has NO TROUBLE AT ALL believing in shape shifters and very little trouble believing in mates. She doesn't even get upset about essentially being felt up by a stranger, being unnaturally attracted to a stranger, or being lied to by both her sister and her strange new lover. Would you be upset if your sister essentially lured you out into the wilderness to meet your destined mate without any warning?? I would have knee capped her.2. Perhaps Ruby herself was unique. There was a reference to the fact that it wasn't normal for the woman to dream of the man, though Ruby did. Instead of pursuing this potentially interesting twist, Carson literally said ""Does it really matter?"" To which Ruby responds ""I guess not."" Okay, so much for curiosity.3. The sister could have actually been missing. Carson and Ruby could have had to work together to save her and his brother...Nope. None of those things happened. There was no plot. No problems or conflicts to be resolved beyond a lack of pop tarts and Lucky Charms. Carson didn't have to court her or woo her or win her over even a little. Nobody had to be rescued. Nobody had to adapt or change. Ruby and Carson never even fought. There was no passion, no spark. They were just automatically attracted to each other enough that any objections were rendered moot. I ask you, what about that strikes you as romantic.Even the magic was muted and pathetic- nothing beyond shifting and only one character does it, even then he only does it once and there are a few minor body changes. They don't even change into real bears for goodness sakes!! Ruby never gets to see this change AND NEVER EVEN ASKS!!! Can you imagine??? Meeting mythical creatures that can change shape, falling in love with one and not even being curious about what the hell they look like, never mind Ruby's defining characteristic was supposed to be her curiosity.BOTTOM LINE: This was the most boring para-romance I've ever read.

That being said:I usually read the lowest rated reviews for a book before I purchase it. I do that because a lot of the time the reasons some readers dislike a book would not bother me in the least. Well, I should have listened to the bad reviews for this book. They are all very accurate. I have NEVER....NEVER EVER read a book where the grammatical errors took anything away from my enjoyment of the book as long as it's a good story. Until this one. There are so many errors that it distracted me to the point where I was actually confused completely. Like another reviewer stated, there are incorrect words, words completely left out, apostrophes where there is no need for them, etc. What really got to me were the ""missing"" words and the ""incorrect"" words. Those mistakes literally made those sentences useless other than to confuse me!!Okay, the story. So, so boring. Nothing happens. Seriously,....nothing. Childhood sweethearts separate for the good of the boy's career. They meet up 11 years later. Well, that's nice. But there is nothing in this book to make it interesting! No jealous exes, no dramatic occurrences while they were separated, no obstacles in the present. I mean NOTHING. The hero, (I use that term loosely) wasn't overly jealous, or possessive (which I LOVE). The leading lady wasn't suffering or in need of help or in need of a ""hero"", she was doing just fine in life. Like I said, NO SUBSTANCE here at all. To top it all off, the very last sentence of this book was horrible. Many may think I'm crazy for thinking that, but without ruining anything for anyone, the last sentence made me think, ""WTF does THAT mean?""This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but even 99 cents is TOO much for this book.LOL I read another reviewer state that the author uses too much vulgar language,...WHERE??????  The ""F"" bomb was dropped a few times, so what??  I also read that this was labeled ""erotica""????  SERIOUSLY????????  No. Absolutely not erotica in any way, shape or form.

Also the feelings of love didn't come through, just that they enjoyed the sex between them.

In the beginning a Zorn Warrior,  Argernon, saves Casey from men who are chasing her.  Argernon & Casey can't communicate so he just throws her over his shoulder & carries her to a cave he's been using while scouting out her planet.  She thinks he's a bigfoot and wants to take him home and keep him because he's ""hot"".  Apparently, he thinks she's hot too, because he grunts/growls at her while gesturing for her to take off her clothes while he strips & continuously points between her & his bed.  Of course, she doesn't usually do this type of thing, but he's hot so even though they've just met, all reservations are set aside.  She strips and gets in bed, still thinking he's a bigfoot.  In the midst of deciding to have sex with him, she even decides she doesn't need to worry about getting pregnant because different species, like cats & dogs, can't procreate.  Just Ewww!When Casey finds herself on Argernon's ship, communication occurs, & she finds out he isn't a bigfoot but an alien and plans to take her to his planet.  She becomes uncooperative.  In several scenes he ties her up and forces himself inside her (while she's pleading with him to leave her alone) because he can smell her excitement.  He even smilingly asks, in his all-knowing male way, if men on her planet are so weak that they listen when women say no.  ?!?!On top of all this, I thought Casey acted completely immature, getting mad at Argernon and throwing fits for stuff that was completely out of his control (but forgiving him for rape), the story was dumb, and the writing was juvenile.  And I liked the first book enough to pay for this second in the series!  I won't be reading this author again.And this is so petty, I hate to mention it, but did anyone else think the cover was unappealing?

Neither was the rest of the book.This book was neither a romance nor erotica but porn. For me the difference is in an emotional connection between the characters. If i don't like the characters but am just reading about them getting their rocks off and the story sucks it's porn. That's what this was. mild spoilers ahead.Mischa- the dom- seems like a tool. He's either 'smug' 'self-satisfied' or 'looking pleased with himself' in every scene. usually after hurting Tom.And then there is poor Tom who decides he might like to try out some bdsm so guess what his first 'scene' is? CBT! Really? There was no build-up, no connection and the scenes were just vaguely unpleasant. I'm not sure how squeezing some guy's nuts until he cries is actually BDSM as all the rest of it (ritual, trust, an exchange, etc.) was all missing.From a writing standpoint, the POV switches were a nightmare and as another reviewer commented it's hard to tell who is speaking, acting or thinking because there are no paragraph breaks or appropriate spacing. This is not a formatting issue but something the writer didn't do properly. It was sloppy.And there were ridiculous lines in there. Not cheesy dialogue during sex lines which is to be expected but almost ignorant or poorly thought out sentences. For example, there was a sentence that said something like, 'mischa was thinking hard. and when he did that he usually made a lot of money.' What?I had no idea what these people looked like, they were shallow as all get out and I didn't even want to be a fly on the wall while they had sex which is a shame. Their first two 'scenes' are just Mischa telling Tom to bend over and take it. That's not BDSM, it's gay sex.Some authors like Cherise Sinclair or Alexis Snow/Davitt even Anna Martin's Another Way give the impression that the author knows what they are writing about because they've lived it or done great research and have a good imagination. this read more like someone's purient fantasy.Anyway, I'm sorry to say that I really hated this book and have no idea why it has so many good reviews.

One of the main characters became a lawyer right after graduating college (it doesn't seem as if the author knows about the existence of law school) and another main character is given full scholarships and acceptance letters from two different colleges from a high school teacher without even applying to either college.  The mechanics of adoption are also presented really fuzzily.  There are open adoptions available -- it doesn't have to be the way the author presented it.  You also just can't terminate a father's parental rights without giving a child up for adoption -- but I guess a lawyer who didn't go to law school can't be expected to challenge that.Aside from the facepalm-worthy factual errors, this book is just tedious to read.  Shawna is so thoughtless and dumb that she brings the vast majority of her problems upon herself.  The other characters are just like cardboard cutouts surrounding her.  Conrad and his mother are too evil to be believed and the various friends that Shawna makes along the way are just too good to be true while also inexplicably falling by the wayside when she actually needs help.Nobody really talks or acts like a real person.  It was unclear why Conrad wanted a family so much and why he had to have a sixteen-year-old as his girlfriend.  It was also unclear why Shawna would go along with this when she love him so little that she fell for the first guy who asked her out on a lunch date.Everything about this book is purely ridiculous.

It was all over the place, constant name dropping, events taking place that didn't make sense.  I'm going to attribute the author being incarcerated as a reason that certain things weren't researched, then again, the male character dropped african knowledge on the lead character so some research had to be done, but not enough to bring the story together.  There was no character or story development, I didn't understand half the drama because it came out of left field and it wasn't developed enough to make you feel any kind of way.  The premise of the story is actually pretty good and so much could have been done with it but the book needed to be completely rewritten with the premise in mind to make it a good story.  It could have been one, but this author just didn't get it done.  This book was so bad I couldn't help but continue to read it just to see how much worse it could really get.  And it outdid itself.  I would say the author needs to read different styles of writing to come into his own, learn story and character development, like I said great premise but it could have been written a whole lot better.  Winny Williams? 'Back in the days'? A month past her due date to have a 8lb baby? Going to rehab for marijuana? It's a BUNCH of other things that will make you say, huh? And scratch your head.  The author possibly has a future, but much more practice is needed, you'd be okay with this book if the author was lets say between the ages of 12-17 and just started writting just because, handed in the manuscript with little editing and turned it into book form.  It would make sense then, but this is not a good book, it had potential but the writing is NOT up to par at all.","12 18, 2011",A14IGT212T8PZA,Mika,1324166400

For me I get really annoyed when characters, with no backstory instantly speak of love and strong intense passion.  Within the first 3 chapters, the protagonist has visions, instantly those visions of a man turns into reality, and that reality is that this handsome and alluring man is a vampire. During this meeting she is overwhelmingly torn between love/lust and suspicion. This vampire instantly takes her to a library/bookstore and gives her books on vampire lore so I am assuming they can solidify their budding relationship. While reading the books they speak all this drivel about how he is a good man and its not his fault he's a vampire and she will love him anyway- Really?  After an hour?

Dean is smart, suave and totally off-limits for Parker... because Dean is also her niece's baby-daddy. Dean ran out on Parker's younger sister when she told him of the pregnancy and his name has been blackballed by the Quinn family ever since.But there's undeniable heat and spark between Parker and Dean... and when he makes an outrageous bid for her body and whisks her away for a six-day weekend the inevitable happens.This erotic romance didn't sit well with me. There were so many niggling little problems with the entire relationship that I couldn't just let my mind go and enjoy the titillating romance.To start with, Parker and Dean's first meeting left me cold. They bump into one another at a win-a-date charity auction, and Dean chivalrously saves Parker from a grabby ex. Their following exchange is a little bit heated, very flirtatious and bordering on sleazy. But there was nothing in Parker's personality or Dean's hot-n-heavy come-on that I found endearing or warranting of the slight obsession they develop of each other. And I mean `obsession' - because the second Dean learns Parker's name he researches her, can't stop thinking about her and concocts a plan to win her over.... all in the space of a few hours. But I just didn't get what was so fascinating about Parker, apart from the fact that Dean really liked her body, wanted to see her naked and enjoyed `the chase'.More than anything though, I really couldn't understand Parker's attraction to Dean. I mean, yes he is handsome and rich and sophisticated... but he also impregnated and abandoned her little sister! Of course Parker battles a half-hearted protest with her conscience, but when Dean whisks her away to a private island for six days her resolve quickly crumbles.What really didn't sit well with me about all this was that Ann Bruce just throws money at the moral dilemma. `Parker's Price' really isn't a female-empowering read... because Parker pretty easily drops her sister in favour of Dean and his `I know someone who has a private island and he has loaned it to me' schtick. Parker believes that Dean left her sister high and dry when she was pregnant with his baby. I'm not saying that Parker's attraction to Dean is based solely on his assets... but that's kind of how it came across. But I'm sure the private island went a long way to easing Parker's guilt over sleeping with the man who fathered her niece.The dilemma of Dean's parenthood is examined in the second-half of the book... but Parker's confrontation of Dean does take a while to come about - she spends the first half of the book thinking about confronting him and raging at how immoral he is... but she's still attracted to him and wants to sleep with him. Ick.I never liked Dean. He just came across as sleazy and my female intuition was constantly red-alerting during his scenes. It was just little things that added up to a not-nice protagonist (though Bruce didn't mean for him to come across that way). Little things like him undressing Parker when they arrive at the private island and tucking her into bed while she sleeps. Eew. And the fact that he kept suggestively touching Parker even after she firmly said ""No. Don't do that. Don't touch me.""Running alongside the Parker/Dean dilemma romance is a side-story about Parker possibly being stalked... because she finds her apartment door open and some lingerie missing from her drawer. Parker is obviously creeped out and concerned about this stalker - yet when Dean takes it upon himself to have a copy made of her apartment key she still can't help but be attracted to him? I don't think so. Dean just came across as a sleazy sexual predator to me. While it could have worked if Bruce had meant for Dean to be a not-nice anti-hero, she is writing him as a straight romantic interest and it did not compute for me.Sorry. The sex scenes were hot; I'll give the book that much. But otherwise this light romantic erotica did not work for me - I could never get past Parker's moral dilemma or Dean's sleaziness.","09 25, 2010",A33C08C20U6DJ0,"Dee18 ""dee""",1285372800

Come to think of it, that would have been a far more entertaining story than this mess.Where to start? There were sentence-level mistakes that indicated a lack of proofreading (your/you're, the ""creek"" of the stairs, etc.) but I can generally forgive those if the characters are engaging. Dylan and Emmy weren't just not engaging, they were actively off-putting. He's broody and dull, she's chunky and grateful, and I think they hook up because no one else wants to be around them. They start having sex five seconds after they meet and every hour after that, including in the wreckage of a car crash. (In the book's most stomach-churning scene, he's not even conscious for it!)Other problems abound. The stupidity of the dialog is matched only by its sheer volume. I kept thinking that only the sweet release of death would make Emmy shut the hell up, but no. Her conversation was just as inane after death as before. (I guess that was a spoiler, but honestly you won't care.) Oh, and there's an English guy who says things like what ho, I say, old chap and other things dumb people think English people say. And some dead dogs. Are you turned on yet?This is the laziest book I've ever read.

9616,B004A8ZT9A,"[31, 36]",1,"Updated from March 12, 2012 to fix typos in review.Let me start this review with a brief synopsis of the plot as that is lacking in the description.The heroine, Catherine is in a miserable marriage.  She is married to a baron who, based on the storytelling appears to be somewhat mentally abusive.  Her husband is an alcoholic and appears to have some emotional issues.  She is considered the most beautiful woman of her time and her husband likes to dress her as a strumpet when he has the occasional gentleman over.  The hero, Adam is an Earl who is ""lured"" to the castle for a pair of twin horses.  He meets Catherine and based on her looks, falls instantly in love with her.  The question to be answered is how can Catherine and Adam be together given that she is married?  Is it worth scandal for their love to blossom?As I read this book, I find several things incredulous.  First, this ""love"" between Catherine and Adam isn't really that well developed.  I can believe she loves him as she was forced into this marriage at 17 and has been secluded since that time, and Adam does not stare at her breasts that are so amply displayed by her husband.  He is kind and loving to her and teaches her about passion.  However, based on what was told in this story, I am at a loss regarding Adam's love.  Everything that is described sounds like the lust of a tremendously beautiful woman (think, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc.).  I don't see how they had enough non-physical interaction for him to fall in love with more than her face and figure.The author shows Catherine as a sweet and compassionate person despite the lack of such she has received from her husband, but never directly to Adam.  Additionally, there was a scene where the men who were hoping to gain Catherine's favors (she never presented herself as a woman who would grant any) crashed another soiree when they learned that was where she was headed next.  I found this to be absurd.The villain of the story, Catherine's husband Edgar did not seem much of a villain once his story was told.  I would have liked to see more of his story early rather than later in the novel and if done right, perhaps I could have excused the adultery.Overall, I can't really recommend this novel unless someone doesn't care about infidelity.  I found this novel to be weak, the adultery aside and did not care enough about the hero and heroine.  Yes, I finished it because frankly, I wanted to know more about the husband and, was curious to know how the author would get us to the happy ending that is expected in these types of novels.  Despite the novel progressing to the point where Catherine and Adam could be together, the ending left a lot to be desired as well.  I will not be purchasing any additional novels by this author.","03 10, 2012",AHAVDM445MD1W,"Never without a book ""C.""",1331337600

5272,B0047DW9LY,"[3, 6]",1,"I couldn't finish. There are strong points - the core story is familiar (average Joe's life is destroyed, works to obtain revenge), and the details of that story are handled reasonably well.  Valdieron and his life are introduced deliberately to permit us to feel some sympathy before the forces of evil wreak havoc in his life.  Mr. Day conveys a familiar cozy set of place and then burns it to the ground so that we feel Valdieron's anger.  Unfortunately after that the plot advances through external exposition.  Some sort of ghost or ancient spirit has been waiting for centuries to pass along plot exposition which isn't very interesting or well written.  But the second or third appearance the ghost is assigning quests.  At which point the story falls apart.  I lose interest in books where the characters' actions are driven by external forces.  Conflict and drama arise through character motivation and action.I'm also somewhat allergic to the super-human scale of ""save the world"" - Day's conceit that demons are invading from another dimension was introduced well enough to permit me to ignore the scale of the plot at first.  As long as the characters were learning about the external threat through actions that were intrinsic to the story, I was willing to coast along and ignore the end of the world. But if the story is so weak that it needs the services of a century old ghost to move things along, then I've lost interest.  Those ghosts are, both metaphorically and literally, less than two dimensional characters.  Every moment that the protagonist spends interacting with them is stolen from potential character development that would result from the protagonist's interaction with a real, motivated, three dimensional character.I'm surprised because Mr. Day shows a commendable restraint on other matters. There are relatively few superlatives - the main character is scaled like a normal human, not like the astonishingly gifted heroes that inhabit much fantasy fiction. Unlike many other low budget fantasy novels I've read recently, women are depicted well and fairly.  In scenes where gender doesn't matter, gender is given no more attention than hair color or dress; just another attribute to enable the reader to remember who is who. In the very few scenes where gender does matter, it is not possible to predict the character's action based on their gender.  In point of fact the female romantic lead had the promise to be one of the more interesting characters in the book with real, conflicted motivation.I'd suggest that Mr. Day have a chat with a horse person before writing about stallions again; I'm given to understand that leaving a stallion in the middle of a herd of unfamiliar horses isn't the wisest idea.Ultimately I've got a limited amount of time in my life to read, and I'd rather spend it on something with fewer, less obtrusive plot devices.","08 5, 2011",A2668P0KW1HLNC,"Amazon Customer ""CryptoSenex""",1312502400

Frankly, one raw sex scene after another got to be boring and i think the plot was only there in order to hold the sex scenes together.With all his talk of loving his wife, the fact remained that Michael committed adultery over a period of months (and just because he thought his wife was the whore he used for sex doesn't excuse his actions). I also took strong exception to his wife accepting even part of the blame for his actions; the blame for his adultery was 100% his! I am not a prude and I even find many of the sex acts depicted erotic if they are performed lovingly, but I agree with the reviewer that stated the language was coarse and vulgar. I don't think that the crudeness added anything positive to the story and I'm certain that Michael and Clarissa would not use that language at all and definitely not with each other.The most telling attribute of the Regency Period in England was there was a protocol for everything, even the specific way that a lady used her fan to show her interest in a gentleman. (I got that information from Google.) With protocol being so integral to society, this story was totally unbelievable.

Oh wait, then you give your virginity like after 4 days of knowing him, because he took you horse back riding, and snorkeling while the whole time he insulted you saying that you're a conniving gold digger!!  Oh, that's right Stockholm syndrome!!  After he takes your virginity he believes you and lets you call your twin which is the one to marry his brother. But loll and behold, he still doesn't believe you're better than a conniving gold digger and you're only good to be his mistress, yet you gave him your virginity because he's sooooo irresistible!!That's why it took me months to finish this book.  I wanted to kill both of the main characters, I saw no redeeming qualities for Nikias and Diona was just wrong in the head.  The story doesn't end there, but I will not continue writing about it because it just ticks me off.  Anyways, back to my review; the author needs help editing, usage of words, periods and comas.  I have noticed also that a lot of writers don't seem to know that woman is the singular and women is the plural of the word (I had to say it, it's just one of those things that really bug me about the grammar) NO I would not recommend this book not even to my worst enemy, and NO I won't be reading anything else from this writer.","02 7, 2014",A249N3DMQWQM28,Martha L.

JC likes Mollie as a friend and for some reason that is never explained hasn't made a move on Suzy, but does lots of mooning over her.  Mollie joins a fitness club because she is overweight and out of shape presumably so she will be worthy of the dreamy JC.  We know that Mollie is miserable and suffers from low self-esteem because she whines about it incessantly to anyone who will listen and, man, did I ever feel sorry for them.  And now we meet the hero Conner, Suzy's cousin, gym owner and fitness instructor, owner of a muscle-bound hardbody, who falls into instant lust with ""curvy"" out-of shape Mollie. Mollie falls hard for Conner's manly form, but knows that her ""curves"" and the fact that she sweats will turn him off because he is surrounded by evil, predatory, size 2 bimbos who sport fake, pointy nails. (That's how we know they're evil.)  Conner handily seduces Mollie. They have sex, a lot of sex.  Next we get a double Big Misunderstanding followed by makeup sex, the setup for the Suzy/JC sequel, and the HEA.  It's all very high school with everyone running around having secret convos about who likes whom.I hardly know where to begin with the problems I had with this book. If you want to put a plus-size woman with a hot guy, fine, I can buy that.  But it strains credulity to think that a man who has dedicated his life to fitness would lust after a woman who is carrying around enough extra weight to have rolls of flesh and shortness of breath. He doesn't want her to lose weight even though her health is adversely affected and she WANTS to shape up. When Conner's reason for wanting Mollie to stay chunky is revealed, my eyes just about rolled out of my head. Bad agenda, Conner. You need therapy.About those sex scenes. I did not enjoy reading them and I am a fan of well-written erotica. The author must have gone to The Big Golden Book of Euphemisms for Ladyparts.  The overuse of the term ""weeping flesh"" made me worry that poor Mollie needs to see her gyno, stat.The dialogue between the girlfriends...what can I say...unnatural and jarring. Exposition is clumsy, phrasing is awkward, information is delivered via dump truck. The writing is so painfully amateurish that I had to force myself to finish it.

She ushers kids into the super cool-ly decorated room and...spouts a paragraph of simplified solar system info. No responses from the other kids about the speech, none of her thoughts, nothing.

She asks him if it's okay for everybody to fly them. He says yes. Why is she asking him? Why is he giving permission? What are they thinking?When Mira participates in an event we note that she has an idea or does something, but not how she feels. We're told she's afraid of someone but not why or how it affects her behavior. Traumatic things happen but they are never thought of again. Mira's parents move around and talk like a Stepford family.

They are Amon-Kai, a race of beings of which little is known or told to the reader.  We only know that they have pale green eyes and can see really well in the dark.  Also the males have special abilities and grow to a very large size, and as well, turn into murderous beasts every full moon; that is unless they find their perfect mate, and bond her to him (and while I'm at it, what is with all of this bonding forever crap?  She writes about it in every story, where the woman must be ""bonded"" to the male, permanently.  As tempting as it is to go into a rant about the myth of monogamy (as in one partner and one partner only, for life) and how sick I am of seeing this stupid-ass trope, I'll refrain. ) Then they are saved from their curse.  Rachael's older foster brother, Richard, is also Amon-Kai.  And conveniently, his perfect mate also happens to be his sister.  However, the children's mother is disgusted by the thought of her daughter being forced into a nasty, coercive relationship in which her daughter will have no agency and her son will be allowed to sneak into his sister's room at night and molest her, after she comes of age.  After a fight with her husband, she kidnaps her daughter and they move to a land far away.  Sort of.  Years later, Rachael has moved on with her life and gave up looking for Richard years prior.  Guess she didn't have the all consuming desire for him that he had for her...yet another bad sign.  However, it isn't long before Richard shows up, having finally found her, since he never stopped looking to begin with.As adults, Rachael is engaged to another man who is portrayed in classic Evangeline fashion as weak, smarmy, somewhat effeminate, and up to no good.  No doubt Elise's ""fianc&eacute;"" , referenced in her last book, Revealed and who will surely play a part  in her upcoming book Persued, will be shown in the same unflattering light.  It would be a problem bigger than Anderson could ever handle or write about should the fianc&eacute; be an okay dude.  She simply doesn't know how to bring a couple together without coercion or a bad situation that forces them together, or making ""the other man"" or ""the other woman"" bad people so that the good ones will want to get together.  Like a man who turns into a murderous monster every full moon, and MUST have bonding sex with the woman he knows belongs to him (who cares what she thinks about that) to calm him down.  Not cool.  I would love for her to prove me wrong.  The only reason I bother reading any stories of hers are that I've always seen a spark of something special with her writing.  But I digress; further along in the story, there is a scene in which Richard in his beast form, rapes Rachael, who sacrifices herself in order to prevent him from eating her friend who is unconscious.  This scene was sickening and completely unsexy.  I nearly stopped reading there.  This is the second book of Anderson's that I've read, in which a woman who technically consents but is repulsed by the actual act happening the entire time and tries to leave the hero after because of it.  If that's not rape, then it's something else that's just about as nasty. Just because her body reacted to it, does not make it any less rape.  It really troubles me that Anderson uses that in her stories to justify the male's actions (for example, her men often say things like ""you may say otherwise but your body doesn't lie"" in dubious consent/rape scenes.  It kind of scares me a little that her writing seems to infer that a woman becoming wet during rape, means that she actually wants it.) After this happens, Rachael attempts to cut Richard off and marry her fiance, only to have him show up on her wedding day and seduce her.  Slowly she gives into the needs of her body and realizes within the last two pages that THIS IS WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS.  Right?That the hero would want to force this situation on the heroine, struck me as rather unloving and very very selfish.  It made me dislike him as a person.  If he really cared and wanted her to be happy, he'd leave  her alone.  Or at least quit dressing up their relationship in romantic BS language when this story is about as romantic and sexy as watching a girl get raped by a dog.  But, then again, YMMV.","06 4, 2012",AGDD6B0UMNN6U,shyviolet,1338768000

Someone's baby brother?"", ""reads like a dropout loser's fantasy,"" ""writing is usually sophomoric, at times schoolgirl giddy, and always bad,"" ""writing style is awful. Painful even. Lifeless sentences, tired descriptions,"" and Mr. Moats calls ME ""mean"". He also points out that he has legions of followers who applaud his work: I'm happy he has a large extended family.And the final nail: ""All of this combined with the rude responses to other Amazon reviewers by the author and I'm done with this guy for good."" AMEN.""Holy crap,"" he said, then put it between covers, titled it ""Classmate Murders"" and called it a book. I'm still not giving it a one-star because it DID improve. Somewhat.Let me get this straight. An 60-year-old, twice-divorced, unemployed (by choice, having determined his EMPLOYERS to be ""stupid"" and ""jerks"") car lot security guard who lives with his parents (supposedly helping Mom after Dad suffered a stroke but in return for a few chores and errands apparently gets room and board, gratis*) takes it upon himself to stick his nose into two murder cases simply because he went to school 40-some years earlier with the victims?And on what planet would a police investigator disclose pertinent facts of an ongoing murder investigation to - again, a 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - AND cautions this uninvolved third party not to reveal said facts to the press? AND quick-as-a-bunny deem him an ""unofficial civilian advisor""?And the first thing said - again, 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents - uninvolved third party does is spill his guts about the murder (by now plural) and the ""closely police-guarded/ongoing investigation"" facts to his best friend, also - you guessed it - a (concealed-weapon licensed) automobile car lot security guard.Another sticking point: A smart, attractive, sexy 60-year-old semi-celebrity woman may have become reunited with a former boyfriend after 40-some years for some slap-and-tickle, but believe me - NO woman in such a position and still in possession of her mental faculties would completely ignore the fact that the former boyfriend - in 40-some years - had no higher achievement or aspiration than to become a - again - 60-year-old-twice-divorced-unemployed-car-lot-security-guard-who-lives-with-his-parents.That's not suspending your disbelief, it's taking it out into a dark alley and shooting it point-blank through the forehead. That would have been more of a mercy killing than having, at long last, come to the end of ""Classmate Murders"".After reading 19% I had to go back and start over again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Tragically, I wasn't.On a positive note, a little further on the plot does get considerably more interesting. Whether it's interesting enough to overcome its unfortunate beginning and the foul taste left in my mouth from this unfortunate choice of protagonist ""attributes"" is up to the reader to decide.About the only thing I could recommend this book for would be as a classic study in character history and personality traits NOT to give your protagonist. Okay, he's a good guy, has a sense of right and wrong, is kind to his parents and hasn't kicked any dogs by the end of the book. Beyond that, as a general rule I don't require that a book's plot be 100% ""believable"" or even a remote semblance of real life. Still and all, THIS one was completely out of the realm of even MY sense of plausibility.To give Mr. Moats the benefit of the doubt I did read the excerpt from the next book in the series, ""Vegas Show Girl Murders,"" and while it might appear at first blush to be an improvement on 'Classmate', my sense is that the character hurdles enumerated at the beginning of this review are going to be difficult to bury. Still and all - as long as I can get ""Vegas"" for free - I will probably give it a try and hope for better things. For everybody.For those keeping score, here are the standings as far as heads-ups for most reviewers' declared turnoffs:1.) Profanity is present but not excessive;2.) No paranormal, supernatural, sci-fi, or magic components;3.) Little, non-gooey, romance;4.) No graphic sex (note the protagonist, ""has occasional sexual encounters, just not with another human being."");5.) Incest between half-sibs is mentioned;6.) No religious or alternative lifestyle agenda or promotion;7.) Some violence of a low-gory (but not grisly) nature, one non-gory incident of torture;8.) No cliffhanger ending;9.)

(tape-ing would have produced noth-ing, tapping would have been more productive)""My curiosity was peaked.""""...but no one seems knows where.""*after all, the protagonist does confess to having split the money his MOM gave him for gas (for HIS car which is used primarily for HIS job) between the car's needs and his own need for BEER","05 30, 2014",AHJHPNS80A07K,mrsdepass,1401408000

I think they are funny, and I really like the characters she has created.  I would go so far as to say I feel like I am ""invested"" in her Bubba characters.  One grows to care what happens to them.With this book, however, the author lost me in the fourth paragraph when she has the protagonist relate his daydreaming in social studies class while he picks his nose.  He then tells the reader that picking his nose helps him think more clearly.  What?  I don't know who would find this topic interesting, but once I was past first or second grade, this sort of ""bathroom humor"" no longer seemed funny or interesting.  It just seemed it was undignified, out of place, and just plain foolish.Within a few more pages, the author has a Marine recruiter tell the protagonist he will become the ""biggest, baddest, mother------ in the whole damn state of Louisiana.""  I spent my whole career working for the Department of Defense, and I spent quite a bit of time with recruiters from all of the services.  Based on my life experience, would I expect a Marine recruiter might say such a thing? Absolutely.  Then again, I have heard that same vulgarity (and many others) from co-workers, neighbors, and many other folks in many places.  In spite of that fact, I think the author's point could have been made without the use of that vulgarity.  It was another turn-off for me.  I think gratuitous vulgarity simply becomes boring.As I have already noted, I was put off by the time I had read the fourth paragraph, but I think I would not have liked this book even without the items I noted above.  As something of an autobiographical story of her time in the service, I simply did not find it interesting.  I am not sure what she wanted me to receive from the book, but it was not a good story to me.  As I continued on with the book, I found myself skimming the pages just to get to the end.Besides the ""Bubba"" books, I have several other books by Mz. Bevill to read, and I hope I find more of her stories to like.  She certainly makes me happy reading about Bubba.Best wishes,Dave Wile","12 6, 2012",A113RPIOZ3HC4M,David C. Wile,1354752000

The author has no idea where to use a comma - he doesn't have them where they're supposed to be, and apparently inserts them completely at random elsewhere, as I could detect no pattern. He also throws in the occasional semicolon just to expand the range of punctuation marks he uses incorrectly.He uses almost no contractions, which makes the narrative and dialog even more  stilted, contrived and clunky.When he's not using cliches, his original descriptive phrases are astonishing in their badness: 'The homeless man slowly put one uneasy foot in front of the other...', a zombie's wrist broke 'with a thunderous crunching sound', and a building had 'outside entrances, almost like a massive cancerous duplex gone wrong.'Really?The characters are without exception cartoony and one-dimensional, the character development non existent, and the action sequences contrived and unrealistic.The zombies retain self-awareness and rational thought, possess magic zombie-vision, have many vampire-like traits, and can pass for normal humans.I was ready to quit at 25%, but I read through the whole thing to see if it would eventually get better - or at least less bad.

However, this was most likely the intention as it adds to the coldness of the story. The supporting characters are far more engaging, though the evil ""father"" is a true monster and serves only as a vehicle for evil. The best character is the tragic hero, Theroen, but be willing to have your heart torn out when you lose him.PLOT: Basic desperate struggle for love and acceptance- there is serious drug use, battered & abused women, whores, monsters, and other forms of desolation, loss and violence. This story is a tragedy and not one that shows any real hope. An attempt is made at the very end to indicate that Two will survive, but as your heart has been crushed, stomped on and scattered all over the ground by that point, it is too little, too late. There is a climactic point in the story that feels like the end, but then it continues and feels like a different book. I had a hard time reading past this point.BOTTOM LINE: This is NOTHING like your typical Dark Urban Fantasy and far more of a Horror. The images and events are brutal in their treatment of sex, women and life in general. I really, really didn't like it and would like to erase it from my mind, but this is only because it isn't the type of thing I'm into. If you are a fan of Horror and have no need of happily-ever-after, then you might like this.I have no recommendations that suit this book as it isn't my genre.","03 20, 2011",AQNXEOJ4RPCGW,A.

As it happened, I was so distracted by choppy sentences, unbelievable reactions and unrealistic events, I did not enjoy this at all. I only finished it to see what the author did to the characters.Examples:The main character, Greg, single parent of a little girl, ""forgot how short a 6-year-old's attention span was."" No, not if you truly are the sole caregiver. You LIVE with the short attention span.After standing in line for admission to a shelter, in the cold of December, the father takes his shivering little girl to a recently re-met ex-girlfriend's apartment, at about 4:30 in the afternoon, where they drink hot chocolate to warm up. The ex-girlfriend is in her nightie already, but they all decide to go out to a park on this cold, darkening December afternoon. After playing on a swing, the little girl comes back to her dad, and he helps her on with her coat. What, he lets her play outside on a cold December afternoon without her coat on? That must have been some powerful hot chocolate.*SPOILER ALERT*:The father tries to insist on going into the operating room with his little girl who's about to have brain surgery. Please. When she comes back to her room, she's comatose, but not in ICU, not on a ventilator, and there are no nurses around.The father decides he needs to help someone, so he wanders corridors of a hospital with no interference from anyone, makes his way into an adolescent psychiatric unit (which has apparently no security nor locked entrances) spends 5 minutes with a suicidal teenager (who is alone--seriously?) and miraculously, the teenager decides not to kill himself. (Psychological therapy is obviously inadequate to the situation.) Not only does the teen decide to live, but he goes to all the other adolescent patients and convince them life is worth living.THEN the little girl's physician, who has been totally intimidated by the father, offers a job to the high school dropout father, training him to be a counseling therapist. Just like that.Maybe the author should have just told the story of Greg as it happened, how it effected him, and published it as a short story. I'm sure that would have been much more interesting.

Calling it ""garbage"" is being way too kind and is an insult to garbage.  And, maybe that's my fault.  I read the synopsis and it wasn't like anything I'd ever read before, so I was curious how the author might be able to write a story that would capture the interest of the reader.  Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, but this is nothing more than an erotic short story with absolutely nothing for the ""story"" part except sex.  And really badly written sex, at that.First, there is zero plot.  None at all.Second, there is no character development.  I cared less about the characters when the book ended than I did when I started the book.Third, it's nothing short of really bad porn for women.  Don't get me wrong; I'm not against throwing in an occasional smut novel for fluff reading, but this book doesn't even meet the low criteria for the worst smut novel.  The best way I can describe it - since we're really talking porn anyway - is to examine the differences in mens porn and make a comparison.For mens porn, you have Playboy on one end, and then Hustler or ""Jugs"" or some other such disgustingly named magazine to appeal to the male.  With Playboy, at least they can boast to have articles of interest and maybe celebrity articles or whatever.  On the other end - the really bad porn - you have just naked women and ""suds"" in all kinds of disgusting positions.  This book - for women - falls into that last category.  It was honestly disgusting with no redeeming values whatsoever.It's not that I'm a prude.  Maybe this book might've gotten a better review from me - over the top sex included - if there had been ANY storyline.  If there had been ANY attempt by the author than to do anything other than to throw three people together and graphically describe sexual encounters.For my part, I would encourage anyone who is sitting on the fence and can't decide whether or not to read this to NOT.

So glad I haven't  spent the $5.99 a piece for the other two books in the series maybe if the price goes down.

For those that love Aiden and Daisy together so much especially based on this book they deserve each other two crazy people together.

So I feel obligated to post my opinion since I had a very different reading experience.I was looking for a nice little sci-fi erotica novella and instead got written porn.  It was pages and pages of sex with no emotion build up. No emotional investment or interest for me as a reader in the characters. (Literally she opens the door the H says hello, doesn't even introduce himself and within half a page the first sex scene starts.) On top of that I found that there was no real character development - the H starts out wanting to make the H love him and with a tendency to be sexually /emotionally dominant. The h is not all that likeable, closed off and bratty  - but she amazingly goes from this to letting him get ""into"" all her emotional shields in a day and a half with what can only be the sex..... As for the plot I was hard pressed to find one, his trying to get her love??????The sad thing was, there was so much potential in this little novella: an emotionally scarred heroine who in a last ditch effort orders a custom husband who comes out with some ""extras"" from her Christmas shopping list, a hero hoping for love, a loving family, and interfering friends intent on making her happy that could have played lots of hijinks on the road to happily ever after - instead of just being mentioned.If you need story, plot, or characters with any depth I would suggest skipping this one. If on the other had you're in the mood for a hot little read and don't mind the use of tentacles this might be your book.","07 23, 2011",A1P1ANGYIYW6NT,Melissa,1311379200

Calvin, does indeed ""deduce"" that Brock is ""deeply closeted"" but nothing Brock does actually supports that conclusion. He's out to his ex-wife, his son, and doesn't bother to hide the relationship much at all. At the very beginning of the novel, Brock comes out to Calvin's property to give him an estimate on some repair work. Afterwards, Brock goes to a local bar and gets drunk, and inexplicably, Calvin is called to come drive Brock home when he gets too wasted. He directs several gay slurs at Calvin, but then comes back to Calvin's house and sleeps in the same bed with him! Moreover, he and Calvin literally jump into a relationship with no real development at all. Within a week, Calvin and Brock have not only professed their love for one another, but Calvin's given Brock huge amounts of money to solve his financial problems.As for the sex scenes, I commend Mr. Hunt because while Brock has ""sexy muscles"", he also has a ""paunch"" and in general, neither character is supposed to be a stud.A major ""con"" in this book is this: after several of the sex scenes, Brock and Calvin fart in front of one another, and then make comments like, ""Well, shouldn't have eaten the refried beans"" or ""I've just had a telephone pole up my ass"". Surely the author must realize some of his readers are women, who don't appreciate that behavior from their own husbands/partners (and certainly not in bed after lovemaking), but *definitely* don't want to read about it between fictional ""heroes"".","05 10, 2011",A1H32JHQ8H0RIY,Sarah McElroy,1304985600

However, when she opens the door to their line-shack trysting place, it's clear she waited a day too long. Rowe's with someone else--another man.And not just any other man--Justin Cruz, the bad boy with whom she shared one wild encounter, years ago.""This novella is a lethal combination of dreadful sex writing, shallow characterization and unbelievable plot. The loving stalker and the ""we're not gay, we just love each other"" m/m are two of my least favorite tropes, and they're present in full force.To start off, a stint in Justin's POV informs us that he watched Dani for years from afar, keeping his hands off her for years because she was too young. This watching included her trysts with Rowe in the line-shack. I gather Devlin intended this to show Justin's attraction to Dani and how it differed from his fleeting attractions to other women, but it came off as predatory and stalkeriffic. That's a steep hill to climb to regain my respect to be a believable hero, and the novella isn't anywhere near long enough for that.The sex scenes are truly dreadful. They contain such gems as ""The sight of her pale blonde ruff and the deep pink, inner lips framing her entrance, took his breath away."" and ""The slick, wet sounds they made as they came together were just nasty enough to thrill her, and the familiar musky scent and feel of the man working above her smoothed away the edges from her earlier unrest."" The language was on par with free erotic shorts and the imagery anywhere from puzzling (""working?"" really?) to gross, but never erotic. It lacked the subtlety, the tension building and feeling necessary to convey attraction or arousal. Ostensibly these are people who love each other, yet, beyond saying the words to each other, they do nothing to show me love exists here.Dani's brother is portrayed as an impediment to their desire to be a threesome, but his character is woefully undeveloped. As quickly as he appears as an opposing force he disappears, dropping his dissent in a two line conversation. Why bother creating his character in the first place.Altogether, Unbridled is an underwhelming effort from Devlin, who is capable of much better work.","12 17, 2009",A3HHXRELK8BHQG,Ridley,1261008000

It's delivered a bit after 12:00 AM Monday as opposed to print, which gets here when my local post office feels like it, which is quite variable.Better still, I find myself reading much more content per issue than ever. Undoubtedly, some of this reflects font adjustment. But as I pointed out in my review of The Economist, it may also have something to do with the nature of the Kindle edition. Everything is presented in bite-sized nuggets and I'm not distracted by having too many thing to look at.I'm aware there are things in print that don't appear in Kindle. That's OK. I can live without access to extra content I most often wound up not having read anyway.* * * * * *Later on, as part of some price increase, The New Yorker and Amazon arranged that as long as I kept my subscription, I'd have all access, which includes iPad. It worked fine (although  the Apple app is kind-of mediocre -- you can't adjust font). Then, just the other night, I was booted off and couldn't log back in.I called the New Yorker and they, essentially, told me to get lost and call Amazon. I called Amazon, which confirmed I should have been still getting iPad access, but on further investigation, it seems The new Yorker reneged and switched off these arrangements.Wonderful company, huh. What a bunch of mean-spirited dimwits! I can still keep reading on paperwhite, which is quite comfortable on the eyes and easy to handle.

The second coming of the Christian Messiah is at hand as a result of the deeply undercover cloning of Christ's DNA from blood recovered from the Shroud of Turin by a group of religious separatists known as the Vinces.THE SON OF MAN is clearly Christian fiction and one doesn't have to hunt very hard to see the clear parallels to the biblical story of the birth of God's son - the nativity star is represented by a rogue asteroid on a collision path with earth; the immaculate conception is presented via the impregnation of illegally cloned cells into a young virgin; the trek to Bethlehem is re-created as the struggle to reach Omaha, Nebraska, the anticipated ground zero of the collision with the asteroid; and the gift-bearing magi make an appearance as a kindly doctor and a Nobel Laureate physicist. There's even a John the Baptist character who ensures that nothing stands in the way of the birth of ""the Father's only begotten son"".I'll hand one kudo (and one kudo only) to CW Johnson. He definitely has the writing chops to create first rate suspense when it comes to describing the impending apocalypse that would be caused by collision of a mountainous asteroid with the heartland of America. Frankly, that's the only reason I actually finished this dog-eared mutt. But that's it!

Maria, for example, the stand-in for the mother of Christ on this second stab at converting the world, is a virgin only because she's a neurotic, egocentric,waspish whiner that no self-respecting man would stay with long enough to roll into bed.If one examines this novel from a thematic point of view, the theology is a joke and is an excellent example of the many reasons why I am a rabidly anti-Christian deist hanging tentatively by my fingernails on the edge of atheism. (And I know I'm not alone) That a self-centered, narcissistic God would make a second appearance to the world because we screwed up the receipt of his first message and failed to give him his due obeisance; that he would choose to make his appearance through the worldly efforts of a renegade group of arrogant theologians convinced that the end justifies their illegal means; that he would enlist a pederast, murderers, thugs, drug runners and extortionists as his advance earthly agents; that this so-called God would create havoc, mayhem, destruction, heartbreak, chaos and the foundation for a world-wide nuclear war as the climate for his second coming ... well, it's all more than laughable. It's the reason why there is so much antipathy today toward organized religion in general and Christianity in particular.If that's the God that Christian dogma has on offer, then give me the apocalypse but leave me alone after I'm dead and gone. That's one God that I don't care to ever meet.Paul Weiss","05 28, 2012",A3E8QNDC7CV44,Paul Weiss,1338163200

27,B003QHZ5JU,"[2, 2]",1,"This short story is very confusing.I have no issue with unreliable narrators, but it is difficult to tell what is happening in this story because the writing is too poor for readers to be able to draw any conclusions.  Virtually everybody in the story has difficulty relating to others.  Conversations begin and then trail off without any important information being related.  The author doesn't prevent any ""normal"" interactions for us to be able to judge if the characters are the ones who have difficult understanding normal human interactions or if the problem actually is with him.  I had assumed that a main character was mentally unbalanced and waiting for that to develop throughout the story.  However, when the story ended, apparently he had become ""normal,"" making a very unfulfilling conclusion.  Why set up a ""weird"" situation for a short story with all this foreshadowing and then leave it unexplored and unexplained?  The only way the author can advance the story is to tell us -- in simple sentences -- what type of people the characters are (things like:  He was a nice person.  He liked people.  He didn't know why, that was just the way he was).  We're never shown anything through the action of the story.  People are just put in situations, have weird, trailing-off conversations, and then we're subjected to basic statements about the type of people that they are.The environment isn't very realistic either.  Because of some odd wording, I thought at first that maybe the story was set in another country -- but then a character mentions being from ""Michigan,"" which is the only sense of place we got in the story.  We know we're not in Michigan and we're in a city.  Don't hope for anything more specific.  It's a place where a independent office supply story is still in business (and can afford to pay ten dollars an hour for part time help) -- but is it in modern times?  Don't hope for anything specific, because it won't be happening.The characters seem not to know things that we would know.  For example, a character was in ""the war"" and has returned home and worked another type of job.  Later, ""old bruises"" on his face are thought by other characters to be from ""the war.""  However, human healing doesn't work that way and all humans should be aware of that.  Bruises, even ""old"" ones, have to be relatively recent and not from old trauma.The experience of reading this story is kind of like if another species was writing about humans and their interactions.  We know we don't act that way, but to a elephant, these interactions might make sense.The proofreading is better than some earlier reviews stated (I'm going to guess issues were corrected), but still not a professional job.","06 27, 2011",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,1309132800

This is a book about abuse, rape, secrets and lies. If this is not the types of books you like then I would move on.The first part of the book was not to horrible aside from the horrible grammar, overused word, misused words and misspelled words. This lasted all through the book sadly. Everyone was always biting their lips for example. Almost every time someone talked they were biting their lip. This being only one small example.My other issue is that Jenny gets in a relationship of sorts with a Pastor, she also owns a coffee shop/christen book store. Yet she uses the word God a LOT. The pastor even says Oh god several times. To me this just does not fit the characters at all. It makes the conversations and the characters seem stilted.The majority of the book was so unbelievable that instead of feeling bad for what Jenny had gone through I just wanted to laugh. No I am not cold hearted and no I am not saying all this could not ever happen to one person. How she acted and the added characters, Morgan and Chantal for example were just completely flat characters that were very unbelievable most times.The ending was tied up in a nice predictable little bow that was supposed to make you happy I guess but for me a book trying to be realistic and then everything just works out perfect does not fit.

I could not believe this author is supposed to be an established writer as it read as if it was the first attempt by a hopeful teenaged writer.I was left with the impression that the author wanted to make it as ""exciting"" as possible and thus threw in event after event without wasting time on such details as good character development.  Descriptions were horrendous such as ""... she was happy with her cheerleader-like looks and athletic body"" for the description of the main character, Jessica, in the book.There were also jarring word usages that did not fit in with what little characterization we were given.  For example, a policeman who up until this point in the book has spoken in fairly standard English suddenly tells Jessica, ""You might be heroes,"" Patterson frowned, ""but I'm still angry at how you disrespected me.""As a further example of how the dialogue in this book progresses, Patterson then complains about how much paperwork he will have because of Jessica.  Jessica looks out the window and replies ""Sorry. Please don't take it personally.""  There is a lot of that snippiness in the book from the main characters who we are apparently supposed to respect for their tenacity in keeping going when everyone else is going into hysterics and making false accusations.Then there is the fact that perhaps it would have been easier to suspend disbelief and accept such things as the ""coincidence"" that leads Jessica to find out about the job in Salem and the willingness of her parents to allow her to accept a job that she was hired for over the phone without the person hiring her knowing anything about her other than she was an almost 18 year old girl who lived two states away.  Or the fact that once there, Jessica meets two girls who behave questionably and yet almost immediately considers them to be trustworthy friends and thus is willing to go into a cemetary crypt at night with them after knowing them less than one day.  Jessica is repeatedly talked out of calling the police for help when one of the new friends disappears by the other new friend who appears less than stable (to put it mildly.)Yes, Jessica, who repeatedly shows a lack of judgement and whose only growth in the story is a willingness to accept that the supernatural actually is real is the main character of the story.

10702,B004GKMOYU,"[102, 114]",1,"I have no idea how a book that had such a promising premise and a great set up derailed so incredibly for me as I was reading. And 'derailed' is a good term because I felt like I was 'reading' a slo-mo trainwreck. That sounds hyperbolic and I don't mean it to be. But the story just started to unravel in so many ways for me that until the end I did not like, in any way, a single character in this book.Now, I have read a few of Marie Force's books. Some I've really liked and some that didn't work for me in small ways, but not to an extent that I've actively disliked them. I do enjoy her writing because I think she writes messy stories. By that I mean, she doesn't always color within the lines in a genre that sometimes feel it is one formula after the other. I respect that. But this book simply can't be put in the win column for me.**********SPOILERS GALORE********************THIS REVIEW IS ONE BIG SPOILER************************************First I have to say that every character in the book succumbed to one of two ailments: Big A$$ Whiny Baby syndrome (BAWBS) or Super Self Righteousness-itis (SSR). Not one person remained immune.As I mentioned above the set up and premise is really a good one. Ted Duffy is a pediatric oncologist who comes from a super awesome family and has four of the best friends ever. The guys, Ted, Parker, Smitty and Chip, have all grown up together and have known each other forever. They have a summer house they share and one weekend Smitty brings Caroline, a woman he had been dating for only a few weeks. When Ted and Caroline meet they fall instantly in love. For Ted, Caroline is THE ONE. And he's heartsick that she is Smitty's girl. For Caroline Ted also brought the lightning bolt of love. They part determined to let time and distance remove temptation.I have no issues with love at first sight. I am a believer that people can connect quickly and for real, but honestly I wasn't sold on it here. I thought them both simply saying 'She's the one' and 'he's the one' was too simple. I didn't see it, I was told it. But that is ok. The premise is that they fall in love quickly in order to make it worthwhile when they have to break it to Smitty that they are in love.The second time they meet there is no denying anything and they resolve to be together and work through the pain they must cause everyone. For her part, Caroline plans to break up with Smitty and she and Ted plan to tell him about their attraction. So far so good.But of course things don't work out that way. Smitty overhears them talking and figures out what is going on. And this is where the story begins to run off the rails for me and where Smitty becomes the first to succumb to BAWBS. So he realizes that his girlfriend of 6-weeks and his best friend of 20 years have a thing for each other. Does he confront them? Ask them about it? regroup to think and talk it over with the other friends? No he starts playing childish head games to torture them. And then he picks up his toys and runs to Australia while everyone is so worried about what is going on with Poor Smitty. Never mind that he and Caroline had only been casually dating and that he knew she wasn't as into him as he was to her. No, all this becomes as dramatic as a  Chinese Opera.So now that Caroline and Smitty are done she and Ted are free to pursue each other. They plan to tell the other friends that they are now dating but it doesn't work out quite that way. The other friends find out by accident. And this is where the other guys start to succumb to SSR. How could Ted do this to Smitty? He is ruining 20 years of friendship...blah blah blah.But Ted and Caroline stay strong and are so in love. So in love in fact that within 3-weeks of being together they get married. At this point the train jumps the tracks. Everybody is so outraged that it is almost comical. Even Ted's mother who had been so concerned about her only son's long hours in a high stress job and his lack of personal life doesn't take a moment to think 'hmm, maybe I should get to know this girl who has been the only person my son has shown any real interest in in years' but rather 'how dare you cheat on your best friend with that cheating bitch who is a cheating bitch!!!'So this goes on for some time with everyone giving them the cold shoulder, none of the friends coming to their more formal wedding (they had been married by a justice of the peace earlier). Mind you, no one seems at all concerned about Ted's state of mind, marrying a woman he barely knows, or wondering if she's a gold-digger or anything like that. No everyone is more concerned about how this will all affect poor Smitty. Sure, Ted can be construed a terrible friend for jumping into a relationship with his best friend's ex, but they are all just as terrible for not even trying to understand why he did this. No they are content to just wallow in their SSR.At this point I am rooting hard for Ted and Caroline because, really, everyone else around them are just being jerks. In a real life situation like this, amongst a group of friends, people would be taking sides or some would be neutral not wanting to choose one friend over the other. Some would even be happy for Ted and telling Smitty to suck it up. It's not like Smitty and Caroline were married and she and Ted were sneaking around behind his back. The level of outrage simply didn't fit the perceived crime, imo.So remember how I said I was rooting for Ted and Caroline at this point. Well, that is true until Ted succumbs to BAWBS. After all the 'I love you, no I love you more' and them telling each other it was worth the scorn of family and friends to be together and they pinky swear to stand just the two of them against the world...what does Ted do? Well he decides it is just too hard to live without all his friends around. He can't take their abandonment and censure. So he deserts his wife. Yup. He leaves her. Oh, he still loves her just can't be around her because she was the reason it all went south with his friends and family. So he takes a new job in a whole other state and stops wearing his wedding ring. My reaction at these developments was 'Are you kidding me!?!?' And here the train falls off the tracks completely, down a mountainside.At this point, Caroline is the only one who is still worth anything. I'll give Ms. Force credit, she makes Caroline dig in and try to fight for her marriage. For her this was the real deal and I have to say I felt it and I felt for her.But by now I was so over every single person in this book that the only reason i didn't just close it and get on with my life is because it was so late in the story.The kicker for me is that, guess what? Smitty finds his own true love in Australia and comes back all forgiving. Everything is a-ok now that he knows what love is. We call all be friends again! So now that Ted is back in the fold, he can come back to his wife because they have been formally given the blessing of Smitty. Well isn't that special!I was really hoping that Caroline would tell Ted to just F#&@ off! and then leave him to his precious friends. But she doesn't because she's so happy to have him back and tears up when he puts back on his wedding ring. Aw[...] Not!This book made me ragey. I can't recommend at all.","03 12, 2011",A2GO2DPX0E1NFN,"T. Wheaton ""T.W.""",1299888000

Due to some plot device, she woke up in his bed, and of course he was so glad to see a beautiful woman in his bed in the morning, that he proceeded accordingly.  She did not immediately leap from the bed in horror and dismay.  The touching and arousal (!) continued until it was going to go one way or the other and *then* she got up.  All the while thinking he was her half brother.  This happened within hours of her meeting him.  It is not the only instance of them making out and basically doing foreplay while she thought he was her brother.

After a year, she attends a BDSM-themed party she set up as a party planner.  This whole turn of events was so incredibly unrealistic.  First of all, a guy was throwing it for his half-brother.  Who throws a party like that for a  sibling?  Nobody in the book was engaging in any sort of negotiation or conversation about what they wanted to do.  It was just guys throwing their weight around while mouthing bland inane nothings like ""You know that a submissive is really in charge of the scene?""  Well, if that's the case, then maybe try talking about what she wants, what she is looking for in the scene, what isn't on the table for the session?

So, Ethan puts together an elaborate ruse to get David on an island alone.  Then, he tells David that he doesn't get any food or shelter unless he submits to his whims, and that he can't leave.The author kind of tries to paint David as conflicted rather than completely against the idea, but really - it shouldn't matter should it?  Even if some part of someone wants someone else, they should still get to choose.  And no, having food held hostage while the other person gets you worked up and then pretends your final acquiescence is consent is not a real choice.I can't figure how anyone thinks this stuff is romantic at all.  BDSM is all about the submissive partner having the power to put a stop to the behavior or the relationship at any time.  Once you take that away, it isn't games between consenting adults, it is just bullying and abuse of power.  Bullying and abuse aren't romantic, even when the victim claims to be OK with it.  I spent the parts of this book that I managed to finish feeling awful for David, who was being bullied into doing something he did not wish to do.I do wonder why we've managed to reduce the prevalence of rape fantasies in m/f romance, but people still accept it in m/m romance.","06 14, 2014",A3KQ4AAE1CUPN7,"Estarianne ""Fantasy Mom""",1402704000

But the clencher was the sex scene in chapter 2.  It was rape.  She said no, period.  I have a hard time with ""erotica"" that passes off rape as sensual and enjoyable.So, there you have it.  Maybe it gets better after chapter 2, I don't know.","08 29, 2012",A21YRZYSP5K2QI,DJ,1346198400

There were also many times in which names were misspelled: 'Carter' becomes 'Carted', and so on. This book needs the loving care of a good editor!Despite the amateur errors, I was able to finish reading the book. It turns out to be a roller-coaster of events which take place during the course of a high school boy and girl breaking up and getting back together again. Along the way, we experience all sorts of random things from toothbrush abortions to Listerine-chugging pregnant preteens. It's all a bit over the top, but perhaps being shocking is the name of the game here? I would suppose many vanilla people might be shocked at this book. It seems to poke at just about every taboo and deviancy that it can, while drenching every sentence with sex. That is not to say that it hits on all of them - the author doesn't seem to have as much experience as they try to push into their book. Again, the more vanilla readers might get a bit put off by this book, but it's really not that far into the dark side.My gut wants to say that this is a book written for teenagers, but with the level of storytelling regarding adult topics, I'm not sure that would be a wise target audience. Unfortunately, older people are just a bit too mature to relate to the story.

946,B001CN45ZA,"[9, 10]",1,"LIGHT SPOILERS- I don't say anything that you don't get from the product description, but be warned anyway. It's hard to explain what I hated about this book without specific references to what DIDN'T happen. No plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Disappointing book 2 of the Halle Pumas paranormal romance series that starts withThe Wallflower: A Hunting Love story, Halle Puma Series Book 1.. You HAVE to read book 1 first as this one starts during the climax of that book. While I am a fan of Ms. Bell's work, I have to tell you I am REALLY disappointed with this book. Book 1 was overly simplistic, but I could forgive that because it was book 1- this book was a step backwards entirely. I'm not even sure why this story got to be its own book. It could have been just an additional chapter or two in book 1.CHARACTERS: It is possible for characters to be UN-DEVELOPED? Simon and Becky are both great characters- but they were developed more in Book 1 than in this book ABOUT THEM. In fact, many of their mannerisms from book 1 disappeared and they became just cardboard cut-outs of what any couple in any shifter romance story could be. The tension between them evaporated- they were dancing around each other before, afraid and uncertain. Simon was artistic and a ladies' man and Becky was the shy, well-grounded partner in her store, but none of those characteristics were apparent in this story. They actually LOST their personality.PLOT: There was even LESS plot here than the product description implies. This was basically a continuation of book 1. There was no additional storyline. No additional conflict. No new bad guys. No new obstacles. It looked like Becky might have a long road to recovery after the attack- she needed to heal and to come to terms with what happened and finding out about the pumas... and that was all resolved in a couple paragraphs. Becky wasn't mad. She wasn't scared. She wasn't even badly injured. She didn't resist Simon. She didn't play hard to get. Simon didn't have to woo her or apologize. Simon supposedly had been a ladies' man- but even THAT didn't become an issue. No confrontation with Belinda or other exes. No discussion around why they never dated or expressed interest in each other sooner... NOTHING!!! More happened between these two in book 1 than here. It takes exactly one minute for Becky to just accept the existence of werecats, the fact that she's Simon's mate, and the fact that she has been turned into one.Like Max with Emma, Simon changed Becky into a puma without warning and without asking permission. She didn't complain- not ONE word of protest. She wasn't concerned about what it might mean for her life. She wasn't even surprised. Seriously, that's just absurd. If for no other reason than it could have offered something more substantial for the story!!!There was a very bizarre plot element of having Becky able to tell when the phone was going to ring before it did. What on earth was that about? It was cute, but didn't come to anything.BOTTOM LINE: This book was infuriatingly dull. I would tell you not to bother reading it, except I expect you probably need to if you want to bother with the rest of the series. I'm not really sure I do at this point. Ms. Bell's The Grey Court series is MUCH better than this one- at least it has a plot.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series2. Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave: Forces of Nature, Book 1- with frolicking dolphins3. Dana Marie Bell'sDare to Believe (The Gray Court)- sexy, humorous para-romance with all manner of fae: Sidhe, dragons, leprechauns, vampires and more4. Kresley Cole's slightly more adventurous  and intricate magical romance series (never mind the ridiculous title):A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)5. Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob (The Nightwalkers, Book 1)- demons, were, vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy6.

There was no pleasure (no forced seduction here--which I don't like but I know some people do) however, the rape was descibed erotically. And it was not. Also, even after the herione witnessed the rapes of this woman and the woman was telling the truth about something she was doing, the heroine called her a whore.

8329,B003IHW2EY,"[2, 3]",1,"It's been six months but I remember buying this book because I'd seen a semi-positive review on a blog--Dear Author probably--and because a romance of a mixed-race couple in the 1860's Wild West sounded intriguing. Especially since neither character is white.Unfortunately the story didn't live up to its promise.I did like the start of the book, although I did think it somewhat boring. The author spends a lot of time setting the scene and describing the life of a Chinese worker building the railroads for a pittance and the life of a black single woman trying to build a new life and a business for herself and her friend. Bias, racism, sexism, it's all there and prevalent in the vernacular.As if that's not enough to create obstacles to the couple's happiness, there's also their inability to fully understand each other. Quiang speaks but a little English and he and Leah have to communicate through gestures, looks, and touches.There's all this, and what does the author do with it? Nothing. Cullars glosses over all the difficult--and rewarding--steps of a meaningful relationship building and focuses on the paper thin physical attraction instead. There's a brief mention of how Leah and Quiang learn to communicate with the help of a dictionary, but they don't really talk to each other. When they're together they're either taking their clothes of and having sex or putting their clothes on and thinking about having sex. And those sex scenes are bad. There's creaming and there's tumescence, there's orbs and there's the infamous ""her sex"" euphemism.After all that, the story and my rating for it could have been saved had I bought Quiang's interactions with the triad members. I can't really pinpoint my problem with them, but something in the language used left me unconvinced. It wasn't just Wao's refusal to call an erection an erection, it was also how the revelation of the misappropriation was handled. Until then, I had liked Quiang's willingness to engage in shady businesses for quick profit and that both characters had such defined lives outside each other, after it just felt anticlimactic.I didn't want a happily ever after epilogue, I wanted to read how they get there.So what does the book have? Good historical description with nascent characterisations, but without any real character or relationship development, and a whiff of Wild West adventures. It simply wasn't enough for me.","11 26, 2012",A28CZRO0PHRYQA,rameau,1353888000

You&#8217;ve got one guy who starts the story by getting a right spanking off a few blokes, but we never find out why or what led up to it.

He held onto their belts for a moment? Assuming they weighed approximately the same as him, he&#8217;s holding twice his own weight with no anchorage whatsoever.

A crowded party, everyone would have either witnessed him do this or seen the bodies falling through the air and looked round at him. But no, the story just stops right there. It&#8217;s rubbish!Too often we&#8217;re left to guess at the ending.

I think his writing is actually quite good but his plots are rubbish. They have little more imagination than an average schoolboy.

Just seduction, passion, heat that you really can't get into because you don't know the characters well enough to really care at all.Maybe I did get it for free so I should lower my expectations and be grateful, but frankly I gave my book time to this.

I really love Dohner's New Species series, but I'll have to say that I'm not going to be reading anymore about Zorn Warriors.I can respect Dohner's ability to create dynamic cultures in her books. I read Ral's Woman and decided to give Kidnapping Casey a try, but I honestly wish I didn't. I don't like the culture of Zorn (I can respect Dohner's ability to create it, but it doesn't mean that I necessarily like it). I get that its an Alpha Male borderline D/s world, but the way that Argernon and Casey's relationship played out just wasn't cool for me.I'll have to agree with other reviewers here that rape = rape, yes, even if your rapist brings you to orgasm. I thought it was sweet that Argernon cared about Casey so much. I get that she's a gamechanger for him. I don't like that he tied her up (twice) and after she repeatedly says no (twice), they still end up doing the deed and Casey's all right with it. Oh, and he ties her up afterwards, because he doesn't trust her. And keeps her tied up for days, even making her wear a chastity belt so she can't please herself, and parades around in front of her trying to make her want him. Seems like the Zorn guys are no better than their pointy-eared counterparts, the Collis. I did not like Argernon, because he never learns that it is not ok to kidnap and rape someone. Its not ok to replace 3 girls last minute and expect your new girl to accept you. And Casey just seemed like a silent victim. I felt sorry for her. Somebody said that she was strong and could hold her own... silent strength and holding on to her pain? Yea.I felt like maybe I would've liked this book better if it was drawn out a bit more. Like, I would've liked to see Casey go to Berrr and get unbounded. Then she could've dated and get Argernon to win her love. But whatever. This book is what it is. This is the end of the Zorn for me.

I bought the other three books in the series based solely on this book, because I liked Sonny and Garron and wanted to find out how their story progressed. References to the incestuous relationship between Sonny's identical twin brothers starts in the second book, and through character thoughts and conversations, the author makes it clear that the relationship is long-term (going back to childhood), consensual, and accepted without a murmur by the rest of the family and apparently the entire town. I found this beyond disturbing, and promptly returned the entire series for a refund.After returning them, I went back and read the book descriptions more thoroughly, but beyond a vaguely worded comment in the description of the fourth book, none of them carry any kind of warning that these books contain sensitive or disturbing material. I did find references when I read all the reviews of the fourth book, but it should not be up to the readers to warn others about things like this.
