So, I'll say again,in a kinder fashion, I did not enjoy this book. I love fantasy (that's why I read Stephen King, etc) but fiction I like with some believability. This book, in my opinion, had little. Dialogue was weak, boring and amateurish...in my opinion. I also (foolishly) downloaded her 2nd book before reading this one, but could only read about 10 pages before giving up. I was told, within the onslaught of not-very-nice-either comments to my last review, that this was the author's first book and they do get better.","01 19, 2012",A52Y39SZ0HMRX,Ezlypist,1326931200

Perhaps I was just expecting too much, but I found what I did manage to read on the dull and predictable side.  Other reviewers have said there's a bite of a twist at the end.  I didn't make it that far, though with as many times as the author hinted of the male lead's oh so charming draw it was clear some &#34;supernatural&#34; twist was in store.  Unfortunately this short tale just can't hang with other sharp toothed treats.  The possibility of serving up something delightful was there, alas a lack of skilled seasoning left this reader with a rather bland and unsatisfying dish.This is the first short story amongst the free &#34;Naughty Nooners&#34; I have tried out.  I hope it isn't representing the other titles well.  For if it is, there is a very good reason they are free.  With that said, from what I did manage to read, (the first half) the author has potential. It just feels like more practice and perhaps some quality feedback from a well written erotica author or editor could do a world of good and help remove the flavoring of a novice.  [Written on my Kindle and the return key isn't starting new paragraphs for me so please excuse this hell of a run on.  Also, while my review may seem harsh, I applaud anyone who has the courage to write erotica that even so much as tiptoes outside of mainstream acceptance and places it where any Tom, Dick, or Harry can comment on it.  This particular short just lacked a lot to be desired and reminds me of something one might find on a website like Literotica by the dozen.]","12 14, 2010",A2WSG306MDVO0W,AG,1292284800

959,B0032Z751C,"[2, 5]",3,"I received this book as a complimentary copy for review. This is the first I have read of Rebecca Forster's works. I have nothing to compare with her other writings. It was difficult to put the book down once the first twenty pages hooked your attention. The weave of characters and story lines forces the reader to want to move to the next page. What little change in character arc is made up by the rise and fall of tension, not unexpected from this genre. The story, pending changes, could be a candidate for a screenplay. That being said, I found the end a disappointment. SPOILER ALERT: The reader has been led to believe throughout the novel that one of the characters is alive only to discover at the end, she's not only dead, but been dead since early-on in the novel. However, Forster gives us stories and adventures of the woman -- in italics -- that causes us to believe she is alive. Even the protagonist character, Dove, receives impressions the woman is living. (Dove's intuitiveness is explained in general terms in the story and never in depth, an opportunity the author missed enlightening us with some backstory details about the protagonist.) By the end of the book, I felt insulted. If the author wanted this character dead, she could have arranged that at the end of the book, sending Dove on the trail of a new murder suspect in a sequel instead of attempting to mystify the finale.","08 5, 2011",AWTYOE2L8FGCL,Rich'it,1312502400

2507,B002YK44YW,"[1, 1]",4,"If you're looking for urban fantasy with lots of action, and don't mind typos, this is well-worth your time.Synopsis: Count Albritton, a self-styled paranormal investigator, begins by looking into an attempted burglary at the NYC apartment of one of his sorcerer friends. It doesn't take long for this seemingly routine investigation to turn into a battle for the future of the world.Storytelling: five stars. I'm not a fan of clich&eacute;s like ""can't put it down,"" but that was almost how it was for me. I kept picking up my Kindle at odd moments during the day to take in a couple chapters. When my battery got low, I pulled it onto an iPad and kept reading. Lots of action and no long stretches of boredom to counter it. Sexual tension is present, but no explicit sex scenes for those who are offended by such. Character development was okay, we learn more about each of them as we go, but the villain was just a little too two-dimensional.Writing: four stars. If you are put off by a story told in first-person present tense, that's what this is. I didn't notice until I was a few chapters in, though. About a third of the story is a flashback to events that happened before (the story begins with Albritton in a hospital, recovering from various injuries from those events) -- that was a little gimmicky, but the story itself was strong enough to overcome it.Editing: three stars. No glaring continuity errors that I saw, the story itself holds together very well. There are far too many copyediting problems though: dropped words, typos, and so on. That cost the book a five-star rating overall. I hope a second edition, and any sequels, addresses this issue.","05 27, 2011",A3192SNS6AVW5K,"Larry Kollar ""Author of &#34;White Pickups&#34;""",1306454400

(And I have a seriously strong stomach for violence.)  This is rape.  There's no other word for it.  I've recently started reading BDSM books after never having gone beyond so-called ""bodice-rippers"" in my 63 years.  Flat-out rape is a legitimate plot device, but I find the conversion of the victim into a willing wife to be offensive. She fell into the hands of a predatory stalker, and she got gang-raped by him and his employees.  To have her then succumb to his manly wiles just makes her look stupid, on top of that.  I had thought better of the author.  I read Harlequin novels in 1976 where the ""heroine"" fell in love with her rapist and married him, but generally, those were written for very stupid women.Apparently times have not progressed much.  I've read a number of BDSM books lately where the characters are interesting and well-written, and where they make rational decisions based upon the actions in the stories.  Once she stopped biting the head rapist here, I stopped believing this story.I also second the mention in another review that the description of the device they built to hold her was inadequate.  Readers are not incapable of visualizing a device, if the description is clear.  In this case, it was appallingly unclear.  The author might as well have just said that they were using magic wands to hold her and move her around.  Additionally, I was greatly concerned with the eventual use to which the pictures of her were to be put.  It is all well and good to say that the five rapists ""love her"", but the pictures they took and posted on the wall of screens could both be used to destroy her career, and to send them to prison for years, had she chosen to be litigious, as she should have.  It kept distracting me from the story, every time that wall of screens was mentioned.  (What can I say?  I used to work in a law school.)The author is an intelligent woman.  She writes well, and she spells well, and she punctuates well.  Her prose is clear (although not her description of that device).  I gave her an extra star for having paid attention in English class.  And at two stars for content, I was being generous.  Rape is appalling, but understandable.  Falling in love with the rapists, all five of them, is not.  The other reviewers have mentioned the victim's deeply-hidden desire to be loved, and her Daddy issues.  More cliches.  Rape is rape.","11 23, 2012",A3Q0M5NMK725JR,"Gracehoney ""Sue Ann""",1353628800

Heavily relationship based, we get two *adults* coming together with maturity, intelligence, and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay, Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame, but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances...

Which goes really well until they fall down a mine shaft into a deep cavern occupied by a mysterious, ancient ship. The book follows their race for survival against odds that only continue to mount against them....In short, you pick up this book and once you get past the first couple of chapters' worth of set-up, you don't put it down until the characters are safe at the other side. This is great military SF: non-stop action, great tech (there was some serious thought put into their power armor) and an unexpected plot to boot. The author has a pretty impressive background, too; seriously, his other available book is The Emergency Responder's Guide to Terrorism. That's not fiction, mind.I read some of the reviews left about this book and was puzzled by them. Some people complained there wasn't enough character development, and I wondered: good Lord, in what time? People who are trying desperately not to die don't exactly have time for deep conversations about their feelings. This book is solid action from beginning to end: you read it for the same reason you get on a roller coaster, for the adrenaline high. Dominant Species definitely delivers.I did have a couple of quibbles: the author confuses ""it's"" and ""its,"" which is tiresome if you're sensitive to grammar; years of reading forum posts have inoculated me against outrage so it didn't bother me. There were also some wordos (the author liked to use the word ""prosaic"" when he really meant ""poetic"" for instance). And the title is a little misleading given the plot. Otherwise, I found it quite enjoyable.If you're looking for a novel that reads like a summer blockbuster action flick, complete with awesome gadgets and cool extrapolations of future tech, you have got to pick this one up. You can sample it and see if you like it. The whole book's only $1.99. Cup of coffee or several hundred pages of explosions... doesn't seem like a hard choice to me. :)","03 5, 2011",A9JE7NJ37NQTQ,M.

Inexperience in the woman's body and in sex really gets to me.  If you are not grown up enough to know about this subject don't write about it.  Hell as a freshman in high school we were taught in our health class exactly how a woman's hymen works..  If one is female they should know this, if one is male and not old enough to know this they shouldn't be writing sex scenes.Next the in such a short book the sex scene should not span 12% of the book, for one scene.  Either write supernatural fantasy fiction, or write smut.. not very many authors can do this..  This is just another case of how in a short story people fall desperately in love with each other at first sight.. and the name.. really.. people should stay away from the name Isabella or Bella in werewolf or vampire books right now.. gives people a bad taste of the Twilight books, which were NOT good books.","10 24, 2011",A1U3ZVV1V7K077,Amazon Customer,1319414400

The characters, however are merely sketched, and this is not helped by the leaps forward and back through time.  Though the time jumping does not hinder the telling of the story, it puts a barrier between the text and the reader which makes identifying with Meredith's plight difficult to do.

It does:  Ryan shows up at his sister's wedding after being threatened and kicked out by his parents; she welcomes him back with open arms and his childhood friend that he had a crush on protects and takes him in.  There's some explicit sex, and Ryan and Dan the standard sensitive bottom and alpha male protector, respectively.  So, why are there so many positive reviews?  Sometimes a reader just wants a simple ""happily ever after"" and this satisfies on that level.  No, it's not Shakespeare, or even a particularly original romance.  But, it is not the worst gay romance I have read and it didn't set me up for a great story and fail to deliver.  My expectations were low.  I wanted something with some sex and an HEA to while away the time while waiting for my plane.  I don't regret reading it, but it wasn't memorable either.  It was worth the price of an e-book.The lack of actual conflict or tension actually inspired me to read the sequel,To Keep and To Love, to see if the author develops the relationship or builds a plot.  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high and I was disappointed.","02 22, 2010",ACEA95FQS1AVP,Jem,1266796800

It's one of those novels where there are two themes unfolding in alternating chapters. But they tie in together brilliantly.It starts off with creatures from a distance past. The kind of creatures legends are made out of. But people never take as having an ounce of truth in it. You are introduced to Longclaws a clan of animals that are vicious, bloodthirsty yet protective of their own. But they are not alone in this unforgiving world. The reader is taken on an adventure as the book describes them beautifully where you can imagine in your mind what is being written. Kudos on that alone. The picture has been painted well.Enter the Mason family who has a history and knowledge of the creatures. They are the keepers of the entrance that separates our world from theirs. It is imperative the doors remain close. For the alternative would involve chaos and destruction for both worlds.This book starts off a little slow. However I encourage the reader to keep reading.  The twists and turns that comes off the pages will keep your interest as you wonder what happens next. I am always amazed at authors who can create a unique and different world.

My Kindle subscriptions, delivered via the Kindle app on my iPad, save me from myself.  Instead of hunting down magazines at the bookstore--or wondering where they disappeared to from the mail--I just wait for them to show up.  Nice, low-fuss delivery.  And then instant reading gratification.Analog has about half of the science fiction content of its competitor.  It makes up for this with more information from the ""Fact"" side of the fence.  The factual articles, editorials and letters to the editor are interesting and occasionally very interesting.  They wouldn't stand on their own, but are worth the subscription price when bundled with the fiction.My personal take:  I like reading on devices like the iPhone and iPad that also hold a lot of legitimate, technical information.  Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I think I'm getting away with it, but I do enjoy reading Analog and Asimov's in a long, boring, all-hands work meeting.The recommendation:  If you only subscribe to one Kindle magazine for science fiction, make it [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].  If you have the extra time, subscribe to this magazine as well.  It's a good complement with a real-science emphasis less present in Asimov's.","08 21, 2011",ACT2AA008KB31,"John M.

While Amazon apparently doesn't want the details of the copyright dispute to be included in reviews, they can be discovered easily through Google-- query Poul Anderson, copyright dispute, and Project Gutenberg.Simple decency says that, when an author's widow is dependent on the authorized sale of his works for her livelihood, we shouldn't be sending our money to for-profit publishers who aren't paying the family their royalties.This isn't merely a case of disputed legal opinions regarding arcane copyright laws. This is a real flesh-and-blood human being, the woman Poul Anderson loved and to whom he was married for some 48 years, who is being damaged. The only ethical response we as readers of Anderson's work should have is to endeavor to do what we think he would have wanted regarding his work. Anderson's work is delightful and worth reading and re-reading; for that very reason, we should honor its author by purchasing authorized versions.We always have a choice, but somehow, the enrichment of 'Ignacio Hills Press' at the expense of Karen (Kruse) Anderson doesn't seem to be a very good choice.","07 16, 2012",AVY4D87ER3UUJ,PadreZ,1342396800

3223,B002UEP8T2,"[0, 0]",3,"Third book in ""Triple Trouble"" series, preceded byStorm Warning. There are no further books in the series available on Amazon at the time of this review.""Three Dog Night"" is definitely a sequel to ""Storm Warning"", however there is enough explanation of previous books to allow this one to standalone.Plot:Elain has recently accepted she's mated to triplet Were wolves. She's trying to come to terms with what that means. The wolves just want lots of sex.Comments:- Given this is the third part in a series, it is reasonably long (3900 kindle locations). There is plenty of sex, some action and enough plot to hang the book together.- The story of Elain and her wolves picks up almost a month after Elain was ""marked"", so about two/three weeks from the end of ""Triple Trouble"". Elain is settling into being a ""Shifter Mate"", but still they haven't bothered to explain all the ""rules"" she's supposed to know. Nor really get to know her and her past. Come on guys, if you're supposed to spend the rest of your lives together, shouldn't you at least chat every so often?- Sex is generally m/f, with m/f/m/m (for a committed m/f/m/m relationship). There is also m/m and m/m with voyeurs by secondary characters (aiming for a committed m/m relationship). It is worth noting (as has been said by a previous reviewer) the m/m relationship begins with what amounts to rape. I didn't like Elain's ""marking"" ceremony of Book 1 and thought it was ""forced sex"", but this marking ceremony is even more so. It is an aspect of these books I *hate*.  Similarly, the ""hunts"" are difficult, since they are wrapping sex in fear, excitement, apprehension, lust, but absolutely no love. She is setting the men up to force her (which they don't want to do yet allow their primal/feral parts to participate in). It is the whole point of the hunt, submission on capture. That said, it (mostly) works within the plot, the submission parts of ""Shifter"" relationships.- Also, as I have commented on the other two books, the bedroom scenes are ordinary. I don't know what the author is doing wrong but it just isn't HOT. It is frequent, it is lusty, it is in different places and positions, but it doesn't grab me. Often Elain is going into it with a ""just get it over with"" attitude; she enjoys it well enough but would rather be elsewhere. It is a shame, because one of the requisites of ""menage romance"" is they always try to make her happy and don't do it just to fulfill the male needs (otherwise she would never sleep!). There is a demonstrably loving, caring aspect of the sex which seems to be missing. So, lust not love?- More so than previous books, ""Three Dog Night"" finishes on a cliffhanger.Opinion:This is a difficult book to recommend. The plot/story is getting more interesting, with a blood pledge making itself known, unexplained murders, ""creepy"" stalkers and mystery parentage. BUT (and it's a big BUT), the sex scenes are not getting better. The forced m/m marking was world appropriate but nowhere near loving, lust not love. The setting up of the men through the hunts is horrid, lust not love. The desired submission of a (once strong) woman to their Alpha male way of dealing with the world is sad. But it isn't beyond the standard expectations of a Shifter Romance.So, do I want to read Book 4? If it was out right now, probably. To wind up the cliffhanger. Will I look for it down the track? Probably not. I will remember the harsh sex aspects of these books and forget the interesting plot arc. Disappointing.","05 2, 2011",A1ZN2JLLR9GI3T,cathyr,1304294400

It had been four years ago and most of last year they rarely saw each other, he treated her like fragile porcelin instead of a wife; it was moneey from her trust fund that saved the ranch and her salary that kept them in the black yet her name was not on the deed!The moment Rafe sat atop the bull and glanced at the pretty woman with clothes so new they screamed designer he was hooked and when she smiled he was a goner!  Seven seconds later he was thrown but he did not care because he had to meet this woman!  Looking back, the sex was amazing but when she got hired by the county she stayed away longer and longer and he knew she wanted him to do some thing but for the life of him he did not know what!

I know that what goes around comes around and that for my personal rant review of this story I'm going to get it back once I release my story. However, I just didn't like it. If I am being honest it didn't really make a whole lot of sense and it seemed like it was young adult fiction with a little bit of unemotional sex tossed in for good measure. Which these days, a lot of YA books are sex theme based so it really would fit right in.The world-build was a mesh of two different genres that I didn't really understand. Normally I'm a sucker for something new and different. However, this story seemed to take you one place, implant and idea, then totally ruin that idea with something else she tossed in because she wanted to get a whole bunch of things done all at once in a short. If she wanted to create this world more accurately, I think she should have written a full length so she could elaborate better on what she was creating. It basically came off as a little silly to be honest. And normally I'm an easy sell on books, especially shifter ones.

Yes, they were attracted to each other, but it wasn't love and he continued to insist (in his thoughts) that he didn't know why his fellow angels would fall for human women.They were only together for a day until they were bumping uglies (which isn't entirely unheard of - several people engage in overnight relationships) and ""in love"". That part was a little too difficult for me to accept, despite the angel & witch aspect.And the revenge that she wanted against her cheating jerk of an ex-boyfriend? Was just to make him jealous by going to a club and dancing provocatively with her angel. Felt a little too much like high school to me.I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters, and while I understand that this is a novella (which means word count restrictions), I didn't feel that the story was fleshed out enough. Maybe if it had been longer and the characters given more time to get to know each other (or have a supernatural force pulling them together like the werewolves' mating instinct) I might've liked it better.","02 16, 2011",A3ADZTCBZT5NB,Mama Kitty,1297814400

He had always been the one that just wanted to have fun, but things were different with Jessie.  He wanted to possess her, and make her his - his alone.  He was tired of sharing her with her with their childhood friend Clancy, and doing everything her way by her rules.  At Christmas he had made the colossal mistake of proposing which sent her running.  Wade knew she cared about him more than she was willing to admit, so he would just ease her into their relationship slowly to give her the time she needed to get used to it.Jessie had made a pact with her best pal Clancy when they were kids to never marry.  They had both had abysmal childhoods, and had plans to never repeat what they went thru.  She was terrified because Wade brought out feelings in her she had never experienced, and was afraid of.  Clancy knew she loved Wade, and even though it broke his heart, he pushed her where she was afraid to go.  Directly into Wade's loving arms.Wade never dreamed that their life could be so good.  He finally had the woman he had wanted for all time, and she was all his.  While Jessie was still a little new at loving and having a family, he could tell she was born to be part of his large family.  When her horrible for an excuse father showed up on her doorstep, and dumped his small daughter Shelby on them, he knew immediately she was meant to have a family of her own.  Just when they thought everything they ever wanted was in their grasp, Jessie's father showed up threatening to take Shelby away along with Jessie's heart.Jessie had never allowed herself to believe in anything permanent because in her experience it always fell apart, and so she never gave love or family a chance.  Wade helped her to see what was possible if you allowed love to touch your heart.  While the encounters between Wade, Clancy, and Jessie were hot, you always knew where Jessie's heart belonged.  This story has many touching moments, but yet some very steamy scenes.  Good balanced delivery!","08 31, 2008",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",1220140800

The first Zorn Warriors book was pretty good, and more in keeping with her usual tone. This second installment failed on so many levels for me. I couldn't develop any liking for the hero, mostly because throughout the book he continually took away the heroine's choices. While he repeatedly tells the heroine that she's his world and he'd do anything to keep her, he never once considers what SHE wants or how she feels about being kidnapped and forced into a lifestyle she didn't choose for herself.What's more, there's no &#34;a-ha&#34; moment when he realizes HIS happiness is not necessarily the key to HER being happy too. I kept waiting for him to redeem himself but it just never happened.And the heroine seemed weak to me because even though she didn't shy away from physical confrontation, she never really tells him &#34;NO.&#34; That subtext of &#34;her lips say no but her eyes say yes&#34; played here ad nauseum. Her protests were pretty weak and insincere, which makes her either totally spineless or the kind of woman who says one thing, means another and expects the guy to know what she wants without her really saying so.Don't get me wrong, I'll never give up reading Laurann.

This book does it.  The author created characters that were interesting and who became more self aware as the plot progressed.  The premise of this particular  cloning was intriguing as the tale unfolded.The look at belief systems is thought provoking, not pedantic.  The &#34;what if&#34; aspect is interesting to explore with this writer.  He certainly convinced me to suspend my disbelief for these characters and their situations.While some of the descriptions of the military and the space science became a bit tedious and, thus, slowed the pace of the book, the author keeps the reader hooked with a &#34;what's going to happen NEXT&#34; storytelling style.The story, while part of a series, is not self contained.  It does not end in a manner that is satisfying from a complete story perspective.  Although the author did an excellent job of building suspense to the end and interwove various scenes so that the reader was enmeshed in various situations to the end, the actual conclusion of the story seemed rushed.

She lies about her age she is only 18 and he is 26. She thought he wouldn't give her the time of day if he knew her real age. Thinking that he is poor she follows him to his mother's house and lo and behold, it's a mansion. His mother promptly tells her that her rich italian son will not marry a non italian gold digger such as herself. Riccardo the H also tells her that they are too young and to get to steppin'. OUCH.They bump into each other 8yrs later and he finds out she had his baby and now he has an 8yr old daughter. What I loved is that he arrogantly demands marriage. She quite promptly say NO! She is not about to trust him after what he did to her. It was also quite refreshing to read an HP where the h turns the tables on the arrogant H. He sees the h in a club with her date, he leaves his date to go after the h and dances with her. When the H's date approaches the h tells her how the H has been talking about her and are there wedding bell's ringing? I almost fell off my chair laughing when I read that.

The settings are rich and detailed, and the language is elegant and (at least to my eyes) contains few or no historical inaccuracies.- I loved the play back and forth between the two men: the fight for dominance as well as the easing of tension when they&#8217;re alone, especially considering how properly they both behave in public.CONS:- There are scenes from both characters&#8217; perspectives in the story, but I wanted to see a bit *more* from Arsen&#8217;s point of view. I was more interested in seeing inside of the arrogant wastrel&#8217;s head than the lovesick puppy&#8217;s.- We don&#8217;t get to see any of the men&#8217;s past interactions; we&#8217;re simply told about them briefly. As a result, the love Arsen feels for Henry wasn&#8217;t very believable for me.Overall comments: I enjoyed this, but the deficiencies in character development prevented me from loving it. It&#8217;s a pretty short story (1170 Kindle locations), and it&#8217;s at least 50% sex. The romantic element of it felt a bit lopsided to me in that one man is obviously crazy in love and the other has a tinge of indifference about him.","04 23, 2014",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T.

To make matters worse she discovers that she is actually his second wife and that their entire life in California has been built on a lie.  Just when she thought that she couldn't take anymore, she is totally devastated when her husband cuts all ties with her and rushes home to Dundee determined to try and get his first wife to forgive him.  Unable to believe that he could totally abandon her and their children she follows him to Dundee.  With the marriage of Elizabeth's brother Isaac to her husband's first wife Reenie (Big Girls Don't Cry Harlequin Super Romance #1296) the next year finds Elizabeth and Reenie forming a family with their children.  Now Reenie has tried a little matchmaking, arranging a date between Elizabeth and Carter Hudson.  At first Carter and Elizabeth don't like each other, but the more time they spend with each other the more they come to care.  However, Carter tragically lost the woman he loved and Elizabeth is determined that she will never be second best again.The Other Woman touches upon every woman's feelings of rejection.  Both Carter and Elizabeth must deal with their pasts before they find a future together.  Although The Other Woman can stand alone, I recommend that readers first pick up Reenie's story, Big Girl's Don't Cry (Harlequin Super Romance #1296), as it is not only a great read but also will adds the background to this story. Brenda Novak has written a romance with truly complex relationships that keep the reader turning the pages and keeps them engrossed in the story until the last page.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","08 20, 2006",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1156032000

First of all, it ends at 88%, and it ends abruptly, in my opinion. As far as conclusions go, this one seems more like a big question mark. I even went to the next page, expecting more to be there, asking myself, is that it?It ends with really no firm HEA and no I love you. Now, if I'm not getting the I love you exchange between h/H, I definitely need for it to be implied, for the message to be intended by every other act or word leading to the ending. I need to have read the story so far with a clear idea of where both lead characters stand in the relationship. This relationship consisted of a one night stand, a meeting where h confronts H about his tendency to run away from anything meaningful or serious, and then one last night of sex. That's it. That's all they had.Of course I've read books with as little going on, but in those books I at least got strong emotion, conflicted feelings acted out, words depicting depth of love or wanting; I at least came away knowing what both characters meant to each other. Here, with this story, I can't tell you if they will stay together, if they love each other, if they need each other for more than just sexual gratification.It seems to me that h has found her strong, make-her-crawl Dom, and H has found his complete submissive, one who is a natural at it, in and out of bed. Other than that, what else can I tell you about them as a couple? I really don't know. That's how shallowly they are sketched out to me. These two characters have no distinct purpose and no strong motivation at all. They are almost like cardboard cut-outs, just nothing behind them but emptiness.This story had some hot scenes, but have I read hotter? Yes, and I've definitely read scenes with more depth of emotion. This is what's lacking to me: these love/sex scenes needed more meaning attached to them. Without showing me and letting me feel the connection between h/H, the author leaves me hanging, leaves me expecting more, wondering how things will be with these two down the road. In the very last paragraph, H tells h, 'You're more than just a f*** to me.' Oh wow, thanks for clearing that up.For me, this wasn't a fulfilling or satisfying read. You might get a brief sugar high from the sex, but you'll be let down and wishing you'd had something with a bit more substance to it instead.","05 9, 2011",A37J3XRX1TENTS,S. Richards,1304899200

I canceled the paper with the old app because it was too incomplete.  This version has more of what is in the paper.  Sadly you can no longer buy a single addition proving yet again that the Times does not have much respect for the consumer, but I will subscribe to this when I am away from the paper version and cancel when I am in an area with access to the real paper.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I have had the Kindle version of the paper for a year or so and have enjoyed having it on the road.  However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.  I finally had to give it up since it really is inadequate and woefully overpriced at nearly double other papers.  I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.

1753,B002DML10G,"[10, 12]",4,"Plot/Storyline: 4 3/4 StarsMost scenes forward the storyline quite nicely.Some of the scenes involving The Dream were a bit drawn out. It just seemed as though a few of them were a bit redundant and unnecessary.There is some political intrigue in this novel. However, I enjoyed the fact that the author did not harp on it or go into too much detail. That the author chose to focus on the human aspect of it was a refreshing surprise.While it moved a bit slowly at times, overall, this was a fascinating novel of huge scope. The universe created in the pages of this novel is vast and immensely interesting.The ending is edge-of-your seat action. I love the way the author tied up all of the loose ends. It was a very satisfying conclusion.Character Development: 5 StarsThe characters in this novel are extremely well imagined and written. The powerful young man, Senjal, is depicted as a flawed, emotional, gullible teenager. You love him and wish him well, but at the same time you feel that he needs a good spanking (or some discipline, for the anti-corporal punishment crowd).Kendi, another major character, evokes similar feelings in that he needs to become more mature. For a different twist, he is in love with another man who recently rebuffed him.Writing Style: 4 3/4 StarsThe writing style of this author is terrific. The sentences are well structured with no choppiness. The dialogue is interesting and realistic. He speaks well in the voices of many types of characters from female to male to child.The descriptions are somewhat overdone in unnecessary places. The action, however, is portrayed succinctly, something I especially enjoy.Editing/Formatting: 2 StarsThere were many editing type errors throughout this work. Mostly they were typographical type things, such as missing words. Having a verb missing from a sentence can be a bit distracting. One error that really stood out was a misspelling of the word `kidnapping'. This word appeared quite frequently throughout the novel, but was spelled `kidnaping' every time.The Kindle formatting was also a big issue. At odd moments, a capital letter would replace a space and another letter. The letter `J' was the most common and it replaced 'space a' often.Rating: R for some language, violence, and prostitution references","09 2, 2009",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,1251849600

So I downloaded the sample, got comfy in my favorite reading spot, and was riveted.  Not because the book was good--it isn't; it is the equivalent of a digital train wreck.  I kept reading, telling myself it had to get better since so many other people loved it.  Right?Oh, so, SO wrong.A reviewer for another book wrote that readers won't have a problem with writing if they just don't expect too much from the writing.  So...the secret to enjoying what we read isn't the author's skill or craft, it's lowered expectations?  Gotcha.Please, do read this book if you don't expect characters, especially the protag, to be developed.  Or sympathetic.  Please read this if you have a loose definition of what makes a hero.  Please read this if you like your female lead to be cursed with Ridiculously Tragic Back Story Syndrome with a dash of Too Stupid to Love disorder.  Please read this if you don't expect too much from a plot:  Abusive, controlling father who is easily fooled by abused daughter who sleeps under her bed to avoid being raped or molested by daddy's drunk friends instead of acting like the grown woman she allegedly is and moving out of unsafe place but who instead goes off to work AND college so she can support his drinking habit yet arranges to spend time with a stranger who sounds crazy but, sheesh, there's just something about him...the English teacher in me demands that I go back and fix that stinker of a sentence, but I won't.  Why, you ask?  Because if you still want to read this book, you'd be better off to just lower your expectations now and get used to such drek.Where have all the editors gone?  Is there anyone left who will proofread material and give constructive advice as to how to fix BAD writing so that we readers no longer need to lower our expectations in order to enjoy what we read?  Is there anybody with reasonable expectations who will say, ""Gee, Dear Author, if people are going to be willing to spend their hard-earned money on your work, the very least you can do is work hard at your craft to earn their money.""Sadly, in this case, the negative reviews are the most accurate.  I am all for trying new authors, but I don't know how many times I have wasted space on my Kindle for this type of bad writing.

The zipper opens this sleeve 50 percent and can be kept on the device while it is charging.The biggest negative about this product is the price.  I bought this sleeve for my Kindle DX when Amazon featured it as a lightning deal for under twenty bucks.  But even at that price this is overpriced because Belkin makes a sleeve just like this for Apple iPads for under ten bucks.  Why the gross price increase for this one when both are so similar in size?All that aside, this is well-made and fits my DX nicely with very little wiggle room.  It provides good padding and grip, as all Belkin laptop sleeves do, and is ideal for carry-on travel or as protection for the Kindle DX while in a backpack or portfolio case.  But there's not much more room for anything inside this sleeve as there are no other pockets, so placing the recharging cord requires a tight roll.The gross overprice takes a star off an otherwise very good product.Edit 28 May 2011:  I see the price dropped from a ridiculous $44 to a more reasonable $29, but this is still almost $20 more than the just-a-tad smaller iPad cover of the same design.","05 17, 2011",A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,CGScammell,1305590400

11015,B004CJ813I,"[2, 3]",2,"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. I do refer to some events that occur, but nothing I would call a spoiler. Recommendations for alternative reading included.HIGH LEVEL: This shining example of a train-wreck plot is either a standalone book or potentially the beginning of a new series from the talented Ms. Arend. More erotic than her other books, this paranormal romance is full of hot encounters in unlikely places. Unfortunately, while it has its fun moments, this is a real mess of a story and very far away from the level of her other work. Atmosphere is light and very playful and some of the erotica well done, but the storyline is convoluted and forced and the characters are wooden.PLOT: Awkward and stilted- these two characters are thrown together under bizarre circumstances that make no sense whatsoever- even to them. Supposedly both are competent law enforcement officers of some kind, but seem to lack skill in actually solving their own mystery. Very strange connections are made between characters and then abandoned. The criminal investigation that exists as a subplot to the romance is never clarified and ends up getting resolved in a flash of confusion.Random events occur here and there that serve no purpose at all- El's parents' inexplicable living situation wherein they suddenly live in a mansion (not kidding- it sprang up out of nowhere while El was busy avoiding home for no reason), the arrival of high profile guests at her parents' home when they are supposed to be just your average furry Americans, El having to give up her beloved motorcycle to an ex-beau... I was left wondering WHY many of the scenes were written.CHARACTERS: Shallow and undeveloped. Kyle's entire character summed up in one word: SEX. In fact, for the first third of the book I don't think he has a single non-sex related thought. Don't get me wrong- I LOVE erotica, but he just seemed to be a caricature instead of a character. When he finally showed interest in his work the only investigating he undertook was on the internet. El was a little better, but she was confusing. She represses her ""cat side"" to fit in at work, but the book opens with her seducing Kyle in a public changing room? Supposedly there was some tension between herself and her family, but it never materialized in the story- there was just no reason for her to not have stayed in touch with her family and they never fought, no tension, nothing. She has issues with marriage for no apparent reason. No other characters even make an impact on the story, really.ROMANCE: No thrill in the chase here, guys. No playing hard to get and no real deepening of emotion either. The second half of the book was better than the first, as there seemed to be some genuine affection between the two, but by that point it was clear to me that this was just a silly trip down the yellow brick road. There was precious little development along the romance side of things. They went from 60 to zero back to 60 overnight and stayed there. Essentially: seduction, capture, refusal to have sex, mindless capitulation and then bunnies all over the place. I mean really- just because they were forced to stay in the same room they had NO CHOICE but to sleep in the same bed? Even that silly Sandra Bullock/Ryan Reynolds movie was able to work around that issue. There was no compelling reason, not even a SEXY reason, for them to have to give in to their attraction. The end didn't find them escalating their relationship any more than they already had. It was a sweet ending, but honestly anti-climactic and since so much of the rest of the story had not been explained it was a little like exchanging gifts in a burning building.BOTTOM LINE: Don't bother with this one. Terrible example of Ms. Arend's work. Her characters are usually sweet and sexy and here they were just crude and flat.  No real thought went into this story- it was just a complete mess. The romance was unromantic, the mystery wasn't mysterious, the larger world  had potential but any tendril of plot that had potential to paint a bigger picture faded into nothing.RECOMMENDATIONS:1.

10666,B00189ZCY6,"[16, 16]",3,"First of all, let me preface my review by letting you know up front that I don't consider A MATTER OF NECESSITY to be a romance.  It is a fictional FBI crime novel that just happens to feature two men in love.  The crime solving is the central plot, and the romance happens offstage.  Even the sex happens offstage.  In fact, at times it felt like everything in this book happened offstage.  Throughout the entire book I felt like I was reading a summary of a story, not the actual story itself.My problems with this book come from the fact that I never felt as though I was invited inside the story.  It was a very odd feeling.  The author's offstage style is such that I felt like I was reading the Cliffs Notes or watching bits and pieces of the story through a closed window, which was a real shame.  I absolutely adored the characters and I wish I had been allowed to experience their romance and their blossoming relationship first-hand rather than from behind closed doors.  Alex was surprisingly accepting of his love for his best friend and the social consequences that came with admitting he was gay.  Shawn was determined to show Alex how much he loved him and was willing to do anything for Alex's love.  How sweet is that?This is an entertaining book and very worthy of three stars, but I could have easily given it five stars if I'd been invited into the story and allowed to witness the tender romance between Alex and Shawn firsthand.  I recommend this book to fans of M/M cop drama, but romance fans may feel short-changed.","04 29, 2008",AL6WDE46RJ9I3,Amazon Customer,1209427200

The story draws attention to a couple of very real issues in today's world Autism and the issue of how much is too much when it comes to the media digging into people's personal lives and deals with them well, but not too deeply. I only had a minor problem with the story and that was that at times the characters seemed too perfect so that the story didn't always seem believable. I would recommend this book to any one who likes m/m romance stories, but be warned there is a lot of hot, steamy sex in this book and some of it is explicit, so if you don't like that kind of stuff this not the book for you. This is another good book by T.A. Chase. - Ana","03 24, 2010",A1NDI7O9AJDD69,"Tina Pavlik ""Tina""",1269388800

Now I'm an anti-Harry Potter sort of person, so when I saw an amulet was involved I was a little wary. I also come from a completely different writing culture. I needn't have worried!  William has the gift of writing , well what I'd call young adults stories, though anyone could read this and be blessed. He has that knack which pulls you into the perspective of Brian, and tells the tale from a child of his age's point of view. The whole text has for me that wonderful fairytale feeling that I love in the Elizabeth Goudge stories such as the Little White Horse.Brian is maybe old for his age due to the abuse he has suffered in his life but he also acts just like a teenager.  His journey to find the Living water is has great narrative tension and I'm glad that it went on long enough after the climax to make the ending balanced and it sort of ties in to the supernatural of the story.I began thinking, ok, so this is a magical story in many ways, just how would this appeal to any teenager?  Its adventure with a twist of romance, reality and excitement. Yet as a Christian, how is this tale justified. (see my standpoint above).  Of course William related this to the Native Americans, and has a bible verse. Then it hit me, maybe I'm being dense, and William  had this in mind but the whole book is one huge allegory or metaphor.  Come to me and drink the streams of living water (John 4, v 13-14) . As Christians, we all seek and drink the living water of Christ and our lives should then reflect and bless all around them. This is what Brian and Rachel did with their lives. It gives you the gospel message that through Christ we can be all things and bless others.  This book does it in a way acceptable to the teenage mind if they can see it!

Benefiel(Discloser: I received this eBook free in order to write a review)Summary:Flora is approaching her twenty first birthday.  That is normally an exciting time for a young woman, but Flora isn't normal.  She is the first born in her family and, therefore, is the family sacrifice to the Gods.  Her entire life has lead up to the day of her death.  Her sacrifice ensures the Gods blessings on her family.  Flora is a bit of a rebelled but she knows her duty.  She pushes the limits to the fullest extent but she knows what will happen on her birthday.  Her pure body (she's a virgin) will be sacrificed to the Gods.My thoughts: (Some spoilers)For a short story, this novella was packed with a lot of story.  An entire background was given for a society that contains supernatural beings (witches, werewolves, and vampires) as well as lowly humans.  Included with the background for the story, a short tale was included.  While I think that the background information was well done, I'm not sure that the characters were as well developed.  The story happened very fast and I was unclear why chances were taken.  Some of it seemed very convenient to the story.  The idea of sacrifices was clearly disliked by many characters in the story but it seems that it has gone on for quite a few years.  Such ingrained tradition doesn't get challenged on a whim.  There just wasn't enough story invested to make any kind of changes.  Clearly, I am implying that there is a challenge to the idea but I won't say any more about it.Personally, the book was too graphic with too many uses of the F word but if those things don't bother you, then you may like this book.  With all that said, I give this novella a 2 out of 5.","01 7, 2011",A2G2PUX1JP4RZR,"Valerie Fink ""StuckInBooks""",1294358400

1254,B002MPPOZW,"[3, 4]",3,"Maybe it isn't fair to start a review by complaining of the excessive length of this fascinating story.  But even Red Adept in her review highlights that problem right at the start.  And, to be fair. from about 60% of the way through the book I kept wondering when it would ever end.  So the extreme and unnecessary length was a key factor in my reading this book.Now, to be clear, I love long novels.  My favorite book (Tai-Pan by James Clavell) is over 700 pages.  This book I would estimate at about 650 pages (it is 14800+ locations on the Kindle).  And I continually read long books, but mostly in historical fiction- NOT action/adventure.  Those books are usually about 350-450 pages, which would have been the right length for this book.  Only Tom Clancy writes such long action thrillers (like Debt of Honor), but even those books are too long, and he is a best selling author- not a new writer.  So this book needed substantial trimming- I'd reduce it by at least 25% and probably closer to 35%.  There are only so many times you need to read about the characters escaping from the villains.Now, having complained about the length, I will state that the plot was terrific- Mozart in the 21st century, escaping death in the 1790's by the modern day evil company's time machine that brought him to today.  And, then, with his love interest Elisse, trying to escape from their clutches.  I would have preferred more about his music, but the portrayal of Mozart was quite fun.  It is very evident to me that the author based his characterization on Tom Hulce's performance in the movie ""Amadeus"".  (Note that in the book the movie is mentioned several times- so this connection is no accident).I must mention one fantastic scene where Mozart gets into a fiddle contest against Rainman in a honky tonk bar in New Orleans- Mozart plays his Stradivarius.  A real hoot!The time travel aspects, and the back story of the evil company and its device and manipulations are never revealed much- and that is OK.  The emphasis is on Mozart and his escape from his imprisonment.In short, I liked the book,and the premise very much- but the  book was much too long.  A major trimming would have helped enormously. (I downgraded it one star for the length.)A final word on the Kindle formatting.  I did not find it as troubling as the previous reviewers.

Because of my enjoyment of that series I decided to read another one of C.L. Bevill's works.BIG MISTAKEIt is honestly hard to believe that these books were written by the same author.  Where the Bubba books move effortlessly through the plot, 'Dial M for Mascara' is a disjointed, tiresome series of idiotic dialogue and soft core porn.The endless nattering between the characters, especially between Mary Grace and her best friend is so idiotic and 'Shecky Greene' like that it becomes exhausting from the very start.It is supposed to be a comedic mystery, but the level of insipid disregard for the danger the title character is in makes it anything but funny.Many of the characters are clownish and one often wonders what purpose they serve in the story.I ended up deleting this from my Kindle at 70%.

I have become so disgruntled lately with a lot of the junk that is out there. Needless to say, I am very happy that I purchased this book.The story was very good, though I have to admit all the fighting and life/death situations did become tiresome toward the end. The characters were very believable and Wulf was a HOT! HOT! HOT! Alpha male. Very possessive and protective and did I mention HOT? His growling did become ridiculous and I laughed at how often it was mentioned. Waaaay too much - though I like some growling.I really liked reading about a kick butt alpha female who wasn't about to fall into bed with the hero just because of biology and I loved it when she ran away from him forcing him to chase after her.  It was very entertaining and then, damn it, she decides to give in to him with no further effort on his part. I enjoy a story where the hero has to work HARD to secure his woman and sadly, this element seems to be missing in so many romances. There was some of that here but not near enough, in my opinion.Overall though, this was a great book by a talented author and I do recommend it.

Michael not only sees in Kate the submissive she is, but also a member of the Clan, even if she cannot remember it herself, having been adopted as a baby and he won't stop until he makes her his. Kate can't deny she wants Michael but is too afraid to submit to the darkly intense man. So Michael will be patient, wear her down, show her that there's freedom in submission, and hopefully he can do so before he loses control and takes her before she's ready. The clan only wishes to subject their women, who apparently want to be submissive to these men. Kate is an intelligent woman and with Michael she wants nothing more than to have sex with him. She can't seem to wrap her mind around becoming some man's play thing, his outlet for violent sex. Unfortunately, Michael will only have sex with her on his own terms, which frustrates her further. His dominance and his proclivities were what some might consider extreme and sadistic, but his desire for Kate was alluring nonetheless.

If I had bought the books seperately at a standard price I might be inclined to give them 3.5 stars if it was available.Over all the story line in these books was pretty good.  The third book was a bit of a departure from the first two with a whole different plot line going on but it was still well worth the read.The books have an interesting array of characters with completely different cultural and physical aspects which I found interesting.  The story is mostly limited to the city of Elantra with some areas, or fiefs, technically in the city but ruled by other various outcasts or fief lords that even the king wouldn't bother trying to dislodge. We also get hints that these fief lords in fact serve a purpose to protect certain old magic in those areas. I would like to see further development of some stories that include characters from other fiefs besides Nightshade and maybe inclusion or further development of stories based on the old magic contained in some of those fiefs.Some of the main characters, while not overly complex, caught my interest (Nightshade, Sanabalis) and I hope we get more of them in the future.  The emperor we hear about and I assume we'll meet him the future.Unfortunately the main character of the book, Kaylin, just comes across as developmentally disabled.  She's been with the Hawks (a law enforcement group) since she was a child and was basically raised around them.  Although, she admits she failed every class given unless it was, by her definition, practical (IE: weapons, fighting, law, Barrani Language), how could she not pick up many of the cultural or political terms and situations just by being around the people.  She continually asks stupid questions that any normal person raised in that atmosphere would know.  Of course everyone just looks at her like she's retarded and refuses to answer her questions... so she's stupid and you just keep her stupid.  It basically came down to an overdone character type of her being the ""bruised and abused good hearted innocent hero, that basically saves the day by luck.""Apart from that I got sort of tired of hearing about her being broke, needing food, and hating magic and refusing to learn because it's not useful to her... yeah magic would neeeeveeer help you out of a tight situation when you're in danger. LOLI'll keep reading in the future, just because I really do like the overall world and character building and I hope at some point Kaylin evolves a bit and actually realizes she had to learn to use whatever powers or skills she has and stops being a bumbling savior.","02 5, 2011",A1K02U5J7EB24U,"R.

Saul doesn't return home until Saturday morning, exhausted and quiet.Ryce decides to go out to a bar himself after Saul leaves once again on a Friday night.  If Saul can do it then so can Ryce.  What Ryce doesn't expect to find is that he has a Tri Omega mate too when he spots Carrington `Cary' Jones.With a special mate like Cary however, there are possible problems.  Ryce has no trouble permanently claiming Cary but Saul must claim him as well for a true tri-mating to occur.  Ryce and Saul already have big problems so adding Cary to the mix might spell disaster for an already teetering mating.  What if Saul refuses to claim Cary?  What that would mean for the three of them is unthinkable.Sexy wolves and carnal lovemaking gives readers exactly what they are looking for in Stolen Desires.  This is the fourth story in the Tri Omega Mates series and can be read as a stand alone tale.  The romance between Ryce and Cary is tender when needed and rough when necessary.  Also, the emotional turmoil Saul experiences is felt in Stolen Desires.  I think that editing out a bit  of the way through would have kept the suspense and secret more interesting.  It takes too long to find out Saul's big secret which takes away from an otherwise very enjoyable tale.  Having said that, fans of the series won't be disappointed and new readers are certain to find Stolen Desires very entertaining!LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","10 26, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1256515200

He's an omega werewolf who knows he's a Tri-Omega, meaning he's fated to have two mates. Imagine his surprise when he discovers both of them on his photo shoot. Jake and Lucas are the Alpha and Beta, respectively, of a very small pack of gay werewolves. These men all have the same background of having been abused and kicked out of their birth packs at an early age for being gay, considered weak or both. Jake and Lucas have been lovers for ten years. Jake recognizes Leyland as his mate and omega but assumes that Leyland, as a human, knows nothing of any of this. Because Jake and Lucas were kicked out of their packs at a young age, much of the werewolf culture is unknown to them so when Leyland announces that they're his mates, he's an omega, and that he'll be mating them both...well, let's just say that shock is the least of the reactions! None of the pack have ever heard of Tri-Omegas so Leyland has his work cut out for him educating everyone on what it means and what his additional powers are.

There is a word for those who can't stand up for themselves in their professional lives and so come home to stomp all over those at home, and that word IS NOT ""romantic"" or ""charming"" or even ""desirable.""His domination was supposed to be all for her pleasure, but where is his consideration for her pleasure, her heart, her feelings, her peace of mind, ANY OTHER TIME?!? He was going to make this decision, but he didn't even really consult Sarah. While he is gone, he sounds off over the limited communication time he has to another woman. He comes back and expects her to fall into his arms in a very, ""where's my supper, wench,"" sort of way.

Putting a book as a freebie draws in those with no interest in the genre.All that said, the demon tale is one I would choose to read from a favorite author, as I am a fan of horror and supernatural fiction, so I reserve the right to be a tad critical. The set up of the story (the pre-prologue, if you like) was great. It tells the history of the demons, how they came to be. It was well written, interesting & gave me hope that it would be a great book.  As another reviewer stated though, the actual prologue was rather cliche-ridden with Gage and his ""lethal charm"" and Jordan resisting at every turn until she melted into his kisses. But I pushed on....As we know from the pre-prologue, Shadow Demons roam the earth. They are evil, they feed on emotion. Jordan, our heroine, is a vigilante destroyer: cop by day, demon slayer by night, after she witnessed the brutal murder of her partner and lover at the sword of a Shadow Demon.The storyline itself isn't bad, but it does lack development of the characters. Other than Jordan being stubborn and feisty, there's not much else that we learn about her. The twist in the tale isn't shocking - not because I expected it (I didn't at all) but because we didn't get to know enough about any of the other characters to really care, and so when the twist was revealed, it gave me more of a ""oh"" reaction than a ""WOW! I never would have guessed"" shocker.My title calls this repetitive, and it does become so. The same fight scenes replay, but worse - the same sex scene is basically repeated over and over. I think even those readers who love a racy sex scene would be disappointed. By the 3rd replay, I skipped them altogether. Nothing new here.","11 7, 2009",A3JR6D5B9WF5J8,Danielle,1257552000

There is a core group of friends who went to Eton together and raised a lot of hell together, but then became each other's family of choice after some lost wives and children, some were crippled by war, some were disowned by family of birth for being too radical, etc... The group has changed and added on during the years, each man adding a few choice members, but the core group remains. Each book is about a specific member or adventure of the group, so it could be considered a stand alone, but as you get into the higher number books, it becomes more difficult to follow the story without knowing the supporting characters from that core group of family/friends.This book is about Ashkoda Paignton, a half Indian/half British doctor whom we first met when he was suffering from a debilitating disease and was only a teenager. His mother's use of Indian Ayurvedic medicine helped heal one of the Rakehells in the"" Model Master"". Since then, she met and married another of the group and had two children with him, making Ash the step son of one of the Rakehells.Returning home from London to join a medical practice, Ash comes upon a young woman he is acquainted with being mauled and assaulted in the woods. He rescues her, takes her to his home for his mother to examine and gets to know her better, finding out that her sister set her up on that disastrous"" carriage ride"" from which he rescued her.From the time Ellen is rescued by Ash, she's fascinated by his happy family, (his stepfather is her cousin), his political, spiritual and healing beliefs and his gentleness with her. She learns so much from his mother to help care for her own, who had a stroke. Ellen loves to hear about Indian culture and religion. But mostly, she's fascinated with Ash. He's the largest but most handsome man she's ever seen and even though she's normally nervous around men, Ash makes her feel so wonderful.Ellen has no qualms or problems merging Indian culture with British. In fact, learning about tantric practices sounds downright wonderful. But any time two cultures meet, someone's going to be upset, now just to figure out who's spreading nasty rumors before their relationship is tainted with some one else's lies.Heat factor hot.","09 7, 2013",A7AO0PBCKSW82,Cindy DeGraaff,1378512000

9665,B002ZNJLMS,"[1, 1]",2,"This is a part of a book or the start of a book or some series.  Which is neither good, nor bad, just is.  It may be upsetting to some due to cliffhanger ending type that requires (does one wish to) getting the next installments or the full.There are a number of errors related to punctuation and grammar.  In something this short (several pages) - there should be no errors. It really needs a good edit as this is advertising for full length.  As one encounters numerous errors here, ya have to wonder what a full would be riddled with.  When pacing is tossed off continually for errors, one may not wish to invest in future works.Due to graphic design of cover, I thought this was young adult reading material (perhaps) .  Some of the content may be unsuitable for younger audiences.  That is (again) not good or bad, just is.  I imagine there is a huge sci -fi adult audience to target in any case.Aside from editing issues, there is some issue related to content style.  It was hard to picture the fight scene in any real sense which was a let down.  Since much of it was a single fight scene - a lot was missing visual wise.  The world (there are aliens, etc.) was not developed to get a picture of that either.  Initially, it was (related to squid bit) - but details later failed to do anything imagery wise.  I felt, while reading the fight scene, that the actions were confused and did not convey well.  I just got vague images of girls pulling hair and slamming heads on ground - versus laser bullets richocheting about or images of contact fights one can conjure up if given proper details.  I just kept picturing wonderwoman (cartoon version) holding some villian chick by hair and seeing ""pow "" in a bubble over the head of one being hit.  If that is image writer meant to convey - they hit the mark.  If they intended a realist life and death struggle in fight mode they may wish to turn on some Lara Croft Tomb Raider type flicks and watch it done (albietly fairly lamely as well) in better form.I have the other two and shall read them after I have read some other things first.  Perhaps this was /is an initial attempt and writer honed skill in future installments.Hey, if you like sci fi and this is free - give it a whirl before buying the full to see if you want to go further.Christine","07 28, 2012",A30YDY4XKVUBUY,Christine Staeven,1343433600

Billy Buchanan returns to Spearfish as a favor for a business associate.  He agreed as a favor but also because it would give him a chance to re-ignite the spark from his high school flame Eden LaCroix.  For the past ten years he has regretted walking away from Eden. Eden has spent the last ten years building a career and dedicated to the local community center helping at risk kids.  She hasn't had time for real relationships, just the occasional no strings attached hook ups with sexy Native American rock star Jon White Feather.When Billy and Eden see each other for the first time in ten years the chemistry spikes off the charts but Eden is determined to fight it because Billy is working on a project that could destroy her job.  He quickly sweet talks her into seeing him out side the project.  As things heat up between Eden and Billy and they are both realizing they still have strong feelings for each other...dunh dunh dunh....Jon comes home for a couple of days.  Billy and Jon decide they want to give Eden one of her darkest fantasies. BOY O BOY is this a hot menage!I really like Eden, even though she is worried about her heart and Billy leaving her again, she takes charge of her sexuality and is not scared to go after what she wants sexually.  As much as I liked Eden in this story, it is Billy and Jon who stole the story for me.  Both men are sexy and strong.  Billy is possessive, sexy, dominant and vulnerable, I absolutely adore the way he treats Eden and some of the insecurities he displays.  JON...oh my, he is my favorite, don't get me wrong I love Billy, but the way Jon treats Eden before, during and after the menage just melts my heart (among other things), Not to mention Jon is a sexy rock star.  I am over the moon excited that Jon is getting his own novella BALLROOM BLITZ, release date 10/2/12.Folks...let me tell you...if I could get the action that went on in the work out room in WICKED GARDEN I would be in the work out room five to ten times a day!WICKED GARDEN is a great novella perfect for an afternoon when you want to escape for a few hours.  A bonus is we get to see how sexy Lorelei writes non-cowboys, yep be it in a cowboy hat or a suit  Ms. James knows how to write sexy as hell heroes!","09 26, 2012",A3LXRIY0HE71K,"Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews ""Guilty Pleasur...",1348617600
6640,B002HJV4BG,"[9, 9]",5,"I've enjoyed all of Ava March's books, including this one.  Hopefully, it will become available in print before much longer.  Her books specialize in Regency period England, M/M erotic romances.  And they are all filled with scorching hot erotic scenes between well drawn, flawed yet generally sympathetic characters who one hopes will find a way to a permanent loving relationship.  The fact that this (as do all her books) takes place in an era when anal sex could get guys hanged (literally) for sodomy added an extra challenge to a plot involving two men seeking more than just companionship.Her books all involve some strong tension / conflict between the protagonists, and this one is no exception.  Arsen is rich, powerful, sexually adept, socially prominent yet a ""bad boy"" and ""known"" womanizer, but he is not satisfied with any of his previous mistresses and not in search of a virginal young woman / debutante to marry.  Harry is a big, gorgeous, raw-boned hunk, with only minimal sexual experience, who has the ""misfortune"" to have fallen head over heels in love with straight, womanizer Arsen, usually a recipe for disaster if ever there was one.  So the two have some dancing around each other to do before either reveals his true feelings, then those initial revelations are incomplete, leading to some misconceptions and wrong ""conclusions.""  Not necessarily the most creative plotline, but lots of tension and uncertainty, great characters who are flawed but sympathetic, and enjoyable escapist literature.  If that sounds enticing, then go for it and enjoy.","03 31, 2010",A3QYRSZT7YT3X3,K. Peoples,1269993600

5719,B004L2LJ94,"[14, 25]",1,"Okay, I bought In Memory of Greed for my Nook several months back after seeing it become the #1 Top-Rated Political Thriller here on Amazon. It's gotta be good, right?Turns out that was a serious mistake.Boudreau has a fascinating premise in this book--a corporation trying to control the world's seed stocks, an ex-SEAL caught up in the confusion trying to stop it. Unfortunately, the premise is quickly derailed by unlikable, one-note characters and shoddy plotting. Judging by Amazon, this was Boudreau's first effort, and it shows. By the time the book is over, you've completely forgotten about the seed stocks and moved on to a pretty much unconnected plot. If this, and the heavy-handed writing style(never have I seen so many adverbs!) don't ruin the book, the characters will.Mocado, the SEAL and ""hero"" of the story, is a highly-trained superman who never does anything wrong--except when he does something very stupid. This happens with enough frequency that you start wondering why natural selection hasn't weeded this guy out long before the story opens.Roth, the CEO, is a gluttonous, hard-drinking windbag whose chief skill lies in nearly killing himself in his fits of rage. Once again, natural selection.Jenn(no last name), the love interest, whose character really never elicits the kind of sympathy that would make you care whether she lives or dies. There's just not enough depth to her characterization.Keegan, Roth's enforcer, an Irishman whose behavior throughout the novel completely betrays the ""twist"" Boudreau tries to give him at the end.Graves, the politician. Pretty much a carbon copy of Roth, I spent most of the book trying to tell them apart--although Graves is not prone to the fits of rage of the CEO.And Barstow, the female secret agent. She's a good counterpart to Mocado, in that she's a highly trained operative prone to frequent moments of stupidity. She would have made a better love interest than the completely anemic and colorless Jenn, but not by much.I put down the book eight times before finally deciding to finish. Rather than having characters I could sympathize with--half-way through I was hoping for a nuke to eliminate them all and start afresh. To put it bluntly, it was a painful experience, and I'll never trust Amazon's Top-Rated list again. Mr. Boudreau is in serious need of writing classes, and a better editor. His reviewers, on the other hand, are in need of remedial studies in what makes a good political thriller. Try Clancy, Thor, or Baldacci.","01 12, 2012",A327SO0JHFSC7C,Jared Foster,1326326400

For some reason I had expected something way more intense since there seems to be so much buzz about the Lords of the Underworld series. To me the writing seemed kind of amateurish. I'm going to give the rest of the books a chance though because I did buy The Darkest Fire as part of a Lords of the Underworld bundle package and I am curious on the relevance of this prequel.Regarding the hero in the story, as admirable as Geryon was, the description of hooves, fur and horns was a big turn off. I just wasn't feeling the draw at all. Even creepy as he seemed more animal than human.The idea that Pandora's box was built from a Goddess' bones was really cool and I think that I may have enjoyed The Darkest Fire more if I had read it after the first book in the series, The Darkest Night. Perhaps I could have appreciated the importance of Pandora's box more. As for the The Darkest Fire being a stand alone little story; I'd not suggest reading it alone and then giving up. More forward with The Darkest Night and then make your decision if you liked it or not. Since I went ahead and read The Darkest Night right away, that moved my rating for this book from a 2 to a 3.

Gabriel is all alpha male, his wolf nature coming out, hard as a rock if he has to be yet willing to do anything to make Abby his, even in spite of his doubts about a relationship with a human. The sexual tension between them skyrockets, and when they come together, look out!Abby has a history but has made concerted effort to overcome her past and make a good respectable life for herself. Gabriel has no love for humans after the one he was closest to turned her back on him years ago so he swore never to get involved with a human again. Upon meeting Abby, his whole outlook on life begins to change and he realizes that there are humans in the world worth knowing and loving.Don't let the short length of Perception fool you. Patrice Michelle packs so much emotion into this story that you'll be wrung out by the end. She does a fantastic job of bringing her characters and their world to life so that we see them as real people, not just characters on a page.

Then he decided there MUST be at least 500 jokes here. Finally, to be perfectly frank with you, I do not recall laughing at a single one of these ""jokes"".

There were so many grammatical errors, misused words, misspelled words, and British slang being used by LA detectives, it took the readability right out of it. I might recommend this book to some of my 'illiterate' friends only because I know they'll never read it. It got 1 star because there is potential with the story-maybe a complete rewrite and relocate it to London. Police procedures-not even close. And when Patton finally takes on Caldwell, he fails miserably and his backup, while only mildly wounded, doesn't even get a shot off or see where the suspect disappears to? Also, going back to the beginning, if they found the first 2 victim's bodies, why weren't the forensics people able to figure out at that point what Sarah's clues meant?

She took her time to decide that she wasn't ready to commit to marriage to her beau in Arizona and decided to give up a good job that she'd held for 16 years and move back to where her roots are in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.  I also chose this book because I've been all through the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and it brought back nice memories of such beauty.Once Rachel gets about halfway settled in, her friend Isaac comes over to ask a favor of her.  A friend of his died by falling over a cliff to his death below, but police have ruled it either suicide or an accident, but Isaac knows in his heart it was neither.  He wants Rachel to do her own little investigation of this incident.  In between getting her house ready, her gardens done with the help of a landscaper, buying a new car, and meetings for her work, she manages to interview a lot of people who could be connected to Isaac's friend's death.  Some of them certainly have good motives, or at least it seems that way.One of the things I loved best about this book is the gardening and the discussions of the different kinds of flowers and plants that Rachel has.  I could just smell the lemon verbena (which is so hard to control!) and was amazed at the different kinds of hosta. Rachel is someone I could easily be friends with, and she would make a great conversationalist and just an all around fun friend.  There is humor in the book, tension, suspense and romance.

I loved Landon, who was determined to prove to Gloria that he loved her. Gloria is a very realistic character that I think any woman over the age of thirty-five will identify with. I loved the way they blended together.There was one little spot that threw me though. Given the romantic flow of the storyline, the hero used a word during a love scene that pulled me out of the story. It took a few minutes for me to recover, but I did. And, even though that bothered me, I couldn't stop thinking about the love the two shared, and how Landon didn't force himself, or the situation. That redeemed him in my eyes.All Worked Up is a story for the romantic soul in a romance reader.AmeliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","01 6, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1262736000

What this author has done has made me add him to my black list of NEVER TO BUY AGAIN authors. I will never trust this author (or anyone else who does this) to provide an enjoyable reading experience.

He has been fightingagainst the evils in his land with Kelvan as his partner, for a longwhile. Upon meeting Belora, Gareth feels instant attraction, and notesthat it is mutual. Because of the shortage of wives for the knights,life in the Border Lair is a far cry from the beliefs with which Belorawas raised. Gareth can only hope that Belora is able to accept thetraditions in the Lair if she recognizes Gareth as her mate.Maiden Flight is a fantasy with a dash of drama and a lot of heat,which completely fascinated me, but not in the way I expected. I wascaptivated by the contradiction between the almost childlike innocenceof the dialogue and the love scenes packed with steamy sexuality. Inone paragraph there would be pure, syrupy words, then in the next I'dbe reading a scorching m&eacute;nage scene that would blow my boots off.Every character is extremely likable, although they seemed almost tooperfect with very few flaws to make them human.

However, he never thought it would be thrown off so badly that he would go into his mating shift while on board.  Now the most important thing on his mind is not his job, but finding a mate, on the ship, to mate with immediately before he is forced into a lust-induced rage.Calla Fellura, a female tyger, signed onto the crew as a novice interpreter, never dreaming that she would come face to face with a male tyger that would become her entire world.  When the call goes out to all female tyger employees to see if anyone can help, Calla immediately volunteers.  Once locked in with Tryon, Calla realizes that there are lots of things about a shift-mating that she never thought about.If the asteroids and a mating frenzy aren't enough for Tryon to worry about, an eco-saboteur has endangered the entire ship and Tryon will have to come up with a way to save it.  When the ship arrives safely, will Tryon sabotage what he and Calla have found or will the Tyger be able to claim his Tyger lily?Tyger, Tyger Burning Bryght is not only engaging and red hot, but it has the ability to suck in a reader.  Calla is very inexperienced sexually, but knows she has to go to Tryon when his mating shift happens unexpectedly.  Tryon would never have approached Calla under other circumstances, but now he knows that she is not only his shift mate, but maybe his soul mate, too.  When Tryon and Calla first came together, it was very erotic and for me it got even more so as the story went on.  Reading and watching as Calla and Tryon came to know about each other and discover that what they felt was not only because of the shift, kept me turning the pages rapidly.  I will admit that I was disgusted with Tryon for a small amount of time, but then Calla showed him just how a true Tyger lily handles a dense male.  I loved the ending and found it perfect with how Calla and Tryon met.  Tyger, Tyger Burning Bryght is a must read that you won't want to put down even after you have finished it.

Frankly it was like he was being paid to write a story of so many words for a magazine and he suddenly realized that he needed to finish so the story quickly and abruptly ends.The story starts off well like one of Andre Norton's space interplanetary exploration teams making first contact with a new race.  The man assigned the task of making first contact knows the new race cannot be trusted and he knows that they have captured a space ship.  Suddenly within a few questions he solves the puzzle of where the ship is and turns the tables on his captor.  The story ends so quickly it makes you wonder why you wasted your time reading it.

I gave it three stars because there was very little background information given on the two main characters, and it didn't seem as if the author stuck to her own story-line the best.  We're supposed to believe Cullen has been crushing on Sarah for six months, and can barely speak to her, yet after he rescues her he seems to speak to her just fine, then has difficulty speaking to her again, then doesn't.  Not to mention he has a picture of her he had taken and kept in his wallet for months, but it never mentions how (or why) he took a picture of her without her noticing.  I also didn't care for the way Sarah didn't really stand up for herself until the end of the book, despite years of poor treatment from half the town.The sex scenes were good, but the author didn't seem to spend much time putting detail in to anything else in the story.  Sarah challenges the clan leader's wife to a fight that is supposed to be to the death, or if the loser surrenders, she and her family must leave the town forever.  The fight is not described at all; it goes from Sarah issuing the challenge to Sarah and Cullen relaxing together later in the evening.  What?!Not a BAD story, but just not what I was hoping for.

Her family's last assignment for her was to do away with Celino Carvanna, the man who has hurt her in the past.When Celino saw her, he didn't remember her from the awkward girl he knew from before. All he was aware of was being captivated by her, and he would do anything to possess her.I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm glad I did.Though Ilona Andrews introduced a new world in this short read, the setting wasn't hard to understand, perhaps because it was patterned after the Mafia of our world, but it's more than that. The author gave just the right amount of description in order to help the readers understand the Kinsmen world, and she did it without info dumping or sounding tedious.I also like her characters, especially Meli who is the quintessential strong woman, and who rose from the ashes of her vulnerability and past pain without turning hard, enabling me to sympathize with her. I like that Meli didn't immediately fly into Celino's arms when he declared his feelings for her, as had happened in so many books I have read in the past. To the end, Meli was her own woman, forged in the fire of her experiences and the situations life--or people--has dealt her. I have long wanted to read a heroine who's strong like Meli and this story didn't disappoint. I was expecting a twist, but when it came, I was still caught by surprise.

3817,B001XURN06,"[45, 48]",5,"John Galsworthy (1867-1933) was a very popular writer at the turn of the 20th Century.  He was the son of a wealthy lawyer and studied law at Oxford. He became a solicitor in 1890 but never practiced law.  Instead he used his father's wealth to travel and learn about writing fiction from talented authors including Joseph Conrad.In the Forsyte Chronicles, Galsworthy created the history of an extended family that begins in the Victorian era in Britain in the early 1800s, extends through the Eduardian Era in the latter decades of the 1800s, and ends after World War I during the British social and economic turmoil of the 1920s.The Chronicles, now called the Forsyte Saga, is a trilogy of novels: The Man Of Property (1906), In Chancery (1920), and To Let (1921).  The fist in the series sets the stage with wealth earned through the driving motivation of land ownership by the founding fathers of the Forsyte family.  The actors on the stage have landed riches and establish social networks as cohesive as the royal family in England.  Even their relationships are governed by the limits of ownership.  Women are the property of their husbands and accept their roles with the reward of financial security.In Chancery describes the continued accumulation of wealth of the family obtained through careful management of money increasingly independent of private property. There is an unwritten family rule of 4% return on all investments. Social conventions begin to change in the story with the problems brought on by allowing outsiders into the family's closed system through marriages. The women become somewhat rebellious refusing to accept many of the subservient roles that were accepted in the early generation Forsytes.To Let traces the family's fortunes through the turn of the 20th Century as the newer generations begin to consume rather than generate family wealth. This is a time of social and legal conflicts for the family that disrupt the order of their traditional lives.  The focus gradually changes to the youngest members of the family who, because of the devastating effects of the World War, believe that there is more to life than hoarding of riches, commodities that can disappear quickly.  These Forsytes pursue artistic and social justice activities and use the family money to go their own ways. The 4% rule is not forgotten, but rather never known by the youngsters.I first read the Forsyte Chronicles paperbacks in the early 1970s as a young man just out of the U. S. Army after the Vietnam War.  I enjoyed reading and experiencing the stability of the family and social structure of British society in the novels, a real contrast to my life then in California.  I identified with the last generations of Forsytes in To Let, focusing on their individual self actualizing choices.After rereading the trilogy on my Kindle1, I now identify with the more conservative earlier generations of Forsytes described in The Man of Property and In Chancery. I appreciated the change of perspective as I approach retirement, and I gained insight through a life review by proxy. I can relate the work to other great generational novels depicting the turn of the 20th Century, such as Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks.The world is much more interactive now than it was in the Forsyte's mystical Great Britain, and social stress has taken on global proportions.  But the activities of making a living, maintaining family stability, and attempting to reach personal satisfaction remain great themes for the turn of the 21st Century.  I highly recommend the Forsyte saga to readers (especially Kindle readers) who will see that the endless cycles of social life continue and personal development is a product of these social rhythms.","01 28, 2010",A2KJZXIXBHVG0K,Gary Severance,1264636800

I have no issue that I get a free story as an incentive to purchase an entire book, as they authors have given a complete story.My issues lie with the layout and illustrations of the story.  As for the layout I had to hunt for the beginning of the story.  Once I discovered the beginning of the story the formatting using multiple hard returns between each paragraph unnecessarily increased the number of page turns. It made the book seem amateurish or perhaps like a high school student trying to complete a 10 page story when she only has 7 pages of writing.The other issue is that this is a children's story, I would think 8 years and above.  That age group may not require a photo per page it still requires several full page illustrations.  What the reader gets is 4 probably well done illustrations but they are so small as to make the point moot.So if you want a well written poignant story with major flaws, get this.

Quinton was a great character and I loved the way that he found his way back to his Native American roots and that helped him face his present-day issues. Regina was a very complex character; she still has a little bit of self-worth left and it was struggling to emerge under Quinton's attentions. Wayne was a perfect example of how total power leads to total corruption; he is thoroughly evil. Quinton's great-aunt, Whispering Feather (I loved that name!) was marvelously wise and had a very generous spirit that reached out to encompass Regina as well as Quinton. And let's not forget Quinton's dog, Hurricane and Regina's dog, Fury; they had wonderful personalities, as well.This was a very well-written book although the proofreading could have been done better. The imagery was really wonderful; the graphic descriptions really made the people and events come alive for me. I just wish there had been an epilogue so I wouldn't have been left not knowing what happened to anyone.********spoiler alert******** I was very angry that Regina blamed herself for not fighting back sooner, especially when it was clear that the only reason she was able to prevail against Wayne's violence was because of the two dogs protecting her. I worked with battered women and the most likely time for a woman to be killed is when she confronts her abuser. At the very least, she would have been severely beaten.I still got a lot of pleasure out of reading Indian Moon even with its faults, so I would recommend it to others.","07 21, 2012",A3JUXLB4K9ZXCC,Dafna Yee,1342828800

Then the thought of his commander suddenly reappears and he conveniently finds the way to free him and escape with him, leaving his heart with his ward.I like reading books with Stockholm Syndrome, but I can't see why Anyar fell in love with someone like Vanyae who didn't really show a single redeeming quality, apart from what happens at the very end, but at that point Anyar was already in love with the man. My problem is that Vanyae seemed weak, driven by his desires, but not by real passion.I also felt that the writing wasn't really flowing.

I do believe Mr. Williams accurately displays how current society has no staying power in relationships. Instead of working through things, it's easier to toss it to the side and start anew with another. Which is exactly what Preston is doing and his conscience is working overtime trying to save him. He fails to acknowledge how his actions or lack thereof are affecting his current and unborn children.

However, the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying. Laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters. The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature. Now while this can be a part of a character, no one is perfect after all, there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that Laine could act like more than a teenager. At least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession, but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this story, even for the cheap price.

Holy Cow, there's still a lot of good stuff to read but certainly a lot less to look at.Gone are the provocative photographs. Also missing, the lush advertisements for everything from Kohler bathroom fixtures, to a two-page display inviting me to fly Air France.  I'm one who first pulls out and throws the Sunday newspaper inserts into the recycling bin. I never would have thought I'd miss the magazine advertising but I do. At least the New Yorker cartoons remain on the Kindle edition although they are a little washed out but I'm willing to live with that.The e-New Yorker navigation has improved from when I first subscribed. The screen is now divided vertically. Left half contains the section headings, ""The Talk of the Town,"" Reporting & Essays"" ""The Critics."" Toggle over to the right and the articles are highlighted for that section. That makes cruising through the magazine easy enough to make for a pleasant read.I've subscribed to the print edition for more than 20 years and still anticipate Thursdays when it's delivered to my address. I still make it my week's work to read most of the content. These days, though, most of the time I find I'm reading most of the magazine on the Kindle. I use my Kindle to aggregate all my reading material in one place and I like that.Overall, the ""The New Yorker"" Kindle edition presents me with a couple of things I'd describe as a little distracting, just a tick shy of annoying. But those distractions, for me, are more than compensated for by the portability the Kindle offers - and the fact that I can easily archive all the issues.At the end of the day the ""The New Yorker"" is really all about the content, isn't it. And the availability of the magazine loaded onto my device in a readable format every Monday morning by the time I get up makes me one satisfied Kindle subscriber.","05 23, 2011",A1Q86V3UCYW0HV,,1306108800

8389,B0038NN38W,"[1, 1]",3,"This book started off strong. The author is an extremely gifted storyteller and we are immediately thrown into the heat that is Hayden's attraction to Josh.  Her descriptions are stellar and you can literally 'see' the characters, feel the sexual tension and frustration and empathize with Hayden when he thinks his love is unrequited. You care about the protagonists and you're already chomping at the bit at the end of the first few pages.  She writes flirtation and passion really, really well and you will definitely be glued to the pages hungry for more.So why only 3 stars?  There are a few problems.*The author seems to love italics.  They're peppered all through the book for no apparent reason and I had to repeatedly stop myself from altering my 'mind voice' at words that didn't really need emphasis.* I agree with others who have said that the back and forth in the timelines makes for a choppy read.  Just as you're getting into a certain timeline, you're jolted back to another.  It gets confusing as to what happened five years ago and what is present day.However, I took these in stride. They were not huge issues.  For me, the biggest downfall of the book was the anti-climatic backstory.SPOILER ALERT!!>>>>>>*************SPOILER ALERT***********The layup was weak and the story only got weaker.  The attack on Hayden and Josh was not believable.  It pushes the boundaries of plausability for me that two werewolves, ALPHAS at that, even in human form, could not fend off a simple attack from two humans. Josh and Hayden supposedly stand at 6'1 and 6'6, yet even with weres' increased strength, speed and natural survival instinct, our protaganists somehow turn into pre-teen girls who can't figure out how to a) call for help and/or b) defend themselves. I think even Anne Rice's Louis would have gotten a broken arm in.Also unbelievable was the reason Josh gave for allowing the things he did and for staying away during the 5yr lapse.  After reading his weeping account, all I could say was, 'Really?'  It just made no sense and I was really disappointed with that entire storyline. Finally, so much was made of the court case and the book ended without a resolution in that regard.  Why?  The book held such promise!!Others have mentioned the rape scene.  It was not a problem for me as it took all of one paragraph, was only mentioned in passing and was not described in any way.  My problem was that I really didn't see the point of it as it didn't add anything to the story.*******************************************************Alas, after 9 wonderful chapters of meaningful conversations, toe curling and warm-fuzzy-inducing flashbacks and sizzling - and I mean HOT -  chemistry and sexual tension between Hayden and Josh, Chapter 10 catapulted me into a world of syrupy, cheesy and eye rolling dialogue from which I never escaped. Alphas were supposedly still alphas, except now not so much and I found myself skipping around the sex scenes. Something I wouldn't dare do earlier in the book!All in all, this was an enjoyable book which I will definitely read again, but after Chapter 9 it will be skip around city.","02 8, 2011",AS4402KIX1B34,Nile Princess,1297123200

One area they definitely find their way back to is that old fashioned male to female communication with their bodies.

However, a bigger problem with the paper is its size and cost.In my youth, I used to read about half of the week day edition in about four or five hours. (I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.In addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.So the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.  (I'd include the address here, but Amazon blocked it so go to my profile for the list.)The Latest News blog is a blog which is updated several times a day with the latest articles from the Times. Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.Unlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.There are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.Second is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs. If you see an article you want to read later, TURN OFF YOUR WIRELESS until you've read the article. Otherwise you may loose the article with the next update.I have also occassionally lost sync with Amazon's servers. If your subscription doesn't update, just restart your Kindle. It will take a minute or so, but it gives your subscription a kick in the pants and starts updating again.I've been looking for a current news blog.

She is unable to live a normal life due to the severity of her seizures.  Unfortunately, as I continued reading, a feeling of undeveloped characters distracted me from Anna's situation.  Her family members are not realistically described, nor were other characters in the story.  The killer in the story was a disappointment, as it seemed his thoughts and action were not given enough attention by the author.  It almost felt like the writer didn't want to delve too deeply into her characters, which caused me to be unable to develop any feelings about them.  I felt that the description of the surgery to separate the two halves of Anna's brain was descriptive and it is obvious the author did her research.

This is not your typical terrorist or serial killer book. Instead, it is a combination of both.Told mainly from the viewpoints of Major Lane, FBI Agent Catherine, and the `bomb planter,' the reader gets a panoramic view of the events. There are several other portions told from the viewpoints of some of the victims with some background thrown in for empathy with even the smallest of character parts.The only downfall was all of the extraneous scenes. I had to wade through an entire chapter of Catherine going home and getting into her hot tub, alone. I had to sift through another chapter of Lane visiting a mall; I tried to find some relevance, but failed. There was even an entire thread that followed a college student, who was only on the peripheral of the investigation.A good thirty percent of this novel should have been left in the ""Recycling Bin"" on the author's computer. Yes, it would have been much shorter, but the result would be a tightly written thriller.I understood the motive of the bad guy. However, I do feel it would have been made more clear if a certain event in his daughter's life had happened elsewhere. If this sounds cryptic, then I have done my job of not including spoilers.It was very obvious that some detailed research went into the writing of this novel. That made for some interesting, and even somewhat educational reading. Yes, I accidentally learned some things.Character Development: 4 1/4 StarsMajor Lane was a strong character. To depict him with a drug addiction was terrific, but to have it also entertwine so well with the plot was a stroke of genius. I would love to see a new thriller with Lane as an ongoing character.Catherine was also a well-developed character. She was a terrific foil for Lane, providing for not only an interesting love interest, but also how difficult being a female FBI agent must be.Although much of the book was told from the bad guy's viewpoint, his character development was still weak. As I mentioned above, a change in location of an event in his daughter's life would definitely have made his motive more believable, and even could have evoked more sympathy with the reader. As it stood, I just couldn't empathize with him.Writing Style: 4 3/4 StarsThe writing style only suffered on one point. For some reason, in several places, the author chose to use words in all caps for emphasis. I would be reading along, when all of the sudden, there would be a BIG BOOM. This was just distracting to the reading process.Otherwise, the writing was outstanding. The descriptions, though verbose at times, were vivid. The dialogue was realistic with good voice. The sentence structuring was complex, yet easy to read.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsBoth were of professional quality.Rating: PG-13 for Violence and Drug Use","12 7, 2009",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,1260144000

But of course h is portrayed as this super naive 20+ virgin, totally unaware of her own attraction.Anyway, H makes his moves. There is the typical drunken h scene. They get into a relationship. They move in together. They fall in love. H proposes to h. And h turns him down because *** ok, I won't spoil it too much! ***So, sounds almost good, right, even though this premise has been done 500 times we can suspend disbelief. The problem lies in the way it was written. In the last few chapters, there is no emotion to the way the author wrote the scenes. The lack of emotion is so noticeable such that you don't really feel the angst and suffering of h. The big reveal was too clinical. It just ruined the ending for me.

Based on the plot-line, I expected more.  As another reviewer said, what professional would sleep with a wild cat in her home, and sleeping next to her like an overgrown tabby?  This author really needs to watch a few episodes of Animal Planet's ""Fatal Attractions"" series.The ""heroine"" was an idiot.  She could remember the names of NONE of the volunteers on the preserve, and acted like they were all stupid, (in one scene, she overslept and was four hours late, then was pissed when the volunteers went searching for a tiger without her).  The ""hero"" had nothing to recommend him either except that he was well endowed.  The sex scenes weren't even hot.  They were way too drawn out and basically the same text repeated in every scene, just a different position.

This seems like a book written by a teenager... a young teenager, but it turns out not to be the case.There are stereotypes galore- i.e. her token black roommate named ""Tyreen"" that says ""mo fo"" a lot. I found that eye-rollingly offensive.Our leading lady- in the midst of a disaster at her college, asks if they will be renting a chalet in Gatlinburg. Her family is supposed to be from Richmond, VA and she is going to school in Tennessee. It's not a chalet down here. It's a cabin. And if serial killers/monsters are taking over your college and killing a bunch of co-eds that look like you, do you really want to go to a cabin in the woods?! Then again, our character is in the lead for the Darwin award.The protagonist, Txema (obligatory exotic name probably looked up on baby name website), is really stupid. There were how many murders in 24-48 hours and she 1) decides to meet her boyfriend after dark at the library across campus instead of him picking her up at her dorm for no apparent reason than she wants to die and 2) she decides that not only her personal safety and that of her beloved roommate is worth less than an iPad and a book. She sneaks past guards put up for the safety of those on campus. When her boyfriend's house is torn to shreds it literally doesn't cross her mind until Tyreen verbally tears her up for not calling the police.She doesn't even care to really find out what her boyfriend's fate was until he is thrust back into her life to knock her up with an audience.

One minute she was a vixen and the next a victim running from a werewolf through the woods. Justina's ex being a werewolf was a totally random an unecessary plot twist.

There was some magic: magical ring, legend of werewolves come to life in a whimsical way. Overall, however, it was pretty unsatisfying.SEXUAL CONTENT: While it is labeled as ""erotic"" - there was really only one scene of lust and it was just OK. It was sexy in a desperate kind of way, but felt incomplete.PLOT & CHARACTERS: Not really much plot and the story was so short that pacing was irrelevant. Mostly this was just incomplete. It read like a vignette, not a story. The characters were undeveloped, though the man was intriguing. It might have been fun to get to know him better through a longer story.BOTTOM LINE: This story is one word: HARMLESS. Nothing really to it, but nothing terribly against it except that it was too short. If this had been developed into a real book, it might have turned out to be ""just ok.""

10202,B002Y5WVOW,"[1, 2]",2,"You know the way sometimes you're flipping channels and you get to the Science Fiction station and notice they're running some obviously super low-budget made-for-TV movie with some ludicrous premise - and you settle in to enjoy watching an extremely bad movie?It's that well-known ""it's-so-bad-it's-good"" phenomenon. A couple of years ago I happened upon a Sci-Fi Channel offering about a guy who turned into a giant mosquito! Ha, ha! Did you see that one? Boy, it was so screamingly dumb! But it's fun to watch goofy crap like that occasionally because - well -- I'll just leave it to some psychologist to score a government grant some day and explain the why-we-like-bad-entertainment phenomenon.But I mention this because I have just finished reading the short novel, CHUPACABRA, by DALLAS TANNER. I'll come right out with a theory I have about this offering: I'm thinking that Mr. Tanner may have first attempted to write a script for a made-for-TV B movie, shopped it around, got no bites, and so decided to turn his script into a short novel.As the title suggests, this is a yarn using the legendary CHUPACABRA- the goatsucker - of mostly Latin American legend, as a premise. It's some kind of crypto-zoological beast with vampire-like tendencies that preys on farm animals. It sucks its victim dry of blood - but leaves the meat.Unfortunately, reading a bad science fiction novel does not deliver the same pleasure as watching a bad movie. I think it's because you have to work harder - you know, with the reading, and all. When you watch a terrible TV movie, you just sit back with a beer and a bag of Cheetos and let the dreck come to you. When you read a B-novel, there's all that effort with the squinting at words and turning of pages, and such.As fiction, Chupacabra makes every conceivable literary mistake a writer can make to ensure that this will be a truly terrible piece of writing - clich&eacute;-cardboard characters, blocks of exposition without action, absolutely no original concepts, and supremely poor editing.Consider: One of the characters is a lovely Caribbean-born scientist who is something of an expert on the Chupacabra. She is alternately identified as: ""an astronomer,"" ""an astrologer,"" ""an astronomist,"" and ""a technician."" I take pains to point this out to show you that I am not merely being purposefully mean and snarky in my review, but that I am only applying the unfortunate credit to where the unfortunate credit it due.You might be surprised that I am going to say now that this author is almost certainly a far, far better writer than this novella suggests. I've been making my sole living as a freelance writer and editor for almost 30 years, and one develops an instinct for those who have ""got it"" and those who never will. Dallas Tanner has what it takes to be a genuinely fine writer, believe me -- I can just tell - but no one will be able to tell from reading this book.","03 2, 2012",A1OICNXB30F29F,Ken Korczak,1330646400

7396,B003XNTYUS,"[1, 1]",2,"Sydney is an in-demand photographer who takes photos of concerts, bands and musicians. Ben is the lead singer of a famous rock group. When Sydney takes a job to photo-document Ben's US tour, they meet and sparks fly.This book started out well. The characters seemed intelligent and even Ben, a late 30's veteran of the rock world, was believable as a guy who had had enough of the fast lane and was holding out for the real thing. But Sydney was a hellacious bitch to everyone. I found it hard to believe that ANYONE wanted to hire her, no matter HOW good her pictures were. She was THAT rude.I understood, from the beginning of the book, that some guy (presumably a musician) had done a number on Sydney (we aren't told what happened until later, but I guessed, easily).  But the way she was automatically in attack mode with every guy she met, was just nuts. Especially when The Incident happened like seven years before this. I am sure it was traumatic but after seven years I would assume she would have developed better coping methods, at least at work. If she had been reserved and avoided flirtations but was clever and could hold her own, she would have been FAR more likable. As it was, I couldn't fathom what Ben, who really was a nice guy, ever saw in her other than her looks (which she dressed to hide.) They had barely spoken one civil word to each other before he seemed to be totally into her. It made zero sense and was completely unrealistic.Then he proceeded to chase her for the rest of the book even though her actions and emotions gave out crazy mixed signals. He even forgave her after barely a minute's anger when she did something I thought was SO reprehensible, I have no idea why he didn't go ballistic on her. But no, he was still hanging in there beyond what anyone (normal? real?) would ever do.A lot of this back and forth (him chasing her as she puts up Huge GO AWAY signs and runs away) happens repeatedly and after a while I was forcing myself to keep reading, hoping it would get better. It didn't.In addition, the story has a number of plot inconsistencies:Why, when there were a number of violent altercations, including the death of someone famous, is there is no mention at all of consequences or paparazzi?In fact, except for controlled interviews, there are almost no paparazzi seen anywhere, ever. And when two guys have a brawl inside a room filled with journalists, nobody mentions a word of it online or in the news.Why would Ben buy a house in Maryland when he knows no one there and his family lives in Northern California? Are there NO beach houses for sale on the Pacific Coast?Why would Sydney's agent tell so many BIG lies for her? At one point I thought her agent (Carole? Can't remember as no character was all that interesting) was going to get rid of Ben with her lies and then declare her own feelings for Sydney and start a bisexual love triangle. Would have added SOME interest to the story, at least.Also, it pissed me off when Ben's ex-girlfriend saw Sydney and told Ben, &#34;I can see why you love her, she's very beautiful.&#34; Really? That's why you love someone? But it actually seemed that way, because he was so infatuated with her so quickly and for no discernible reason.In any case, I wasn't going to write a review, I just wanted to move on and forget this one. But I decided to spare others from the boredom I endured while reading this book. There is a happy ending, but by the time it rolled around, I didn't care.Save your money and buy something else. You'll thank me.I would NOT recommend this book.","07 20, 2013",A2ZE23JR2H2PJ7,SK,1374278400

Her decision to cut loose and celebrate her freedom from the crown and sash has landed her in big trouble.  The simple fact that she wakes up in a stranger's bed wearing nothing but her Miss Firecracker sash with no memory of how she got there is just the beginning of what promises to be a wild week.Wyoming sheepherder Blake West has been at loose ends since his father decided to retire and sell the ranch.  He jumped at the chance to manage his friend's bar in Nebraska while trying to decide what he wants to do with his life.  Blake is a genuinely nice guy but he's also got a domineering side and for Willow, the combination is intoxicating.Willow has always been more of a tomboy than a beauty queen but when a childhood nemesis entered her name into the contest she had too much pride to back out.  In a way she'd kind of hoped she'd learn to be more `feminine' but let's face it, `ladies' don't get drunk and bust up a bar.  The only thing that kept her from a jail cell is a condition she agreed to - to work at the bar until she's earned enough to pay for the damage she caused.Willow's definitely not happy with this situation, but there's no denying she's incredibly attracted to Blake.  When she thanks him for being such a nice guy and not taking advantage of her inebriated state the night before, Blake sets her straight and defuses any notion she has that he's not interested in her sexually.  Blake's only filling in for his friend at the bar for about a week so keeping any relationship they embark on a no-strings attached basis would only make sense, but the more time they spend together the more they realize that what they share is much more than just sex.Lorelei James' WILD WEST BOYS series has a new addition that is hotter than any 4th of July show.  MISS FIRECRACKER had me chuckling at Willow's drunken antics - and I could only imagine how her clothing ended up hanging from the ceiling fan.  Willow and Blake fit together so perfectly that they're a pleasure to read about - especially when you consider their encounters are hot enough to leave you sweating.  Ms. James is a talented author who never fails to thrill readers with her sexy heroes and delightful storylines.If you haven't read MISTRESS CHRISTMAS yet, don't worry, these stories definitely don't need to be read in order.

10585,B001VLXMB6,"[76, 77]",4,"THIS is why I love my Kindle...three great books for the price of one.  After reading the reviews I thought the Julia Grey trilogy would be worth reading, and for $10 I was willing to gamble on the omnibus edition.  It was a good bet.The Julia Grey books are hybrid mystery-romances set in the Victorian period, best suited to readers who enjoy both genres.  Mystery is the dominant element in each book, but the romance between Julia Grey and Nicholas Brisbane is the backbone to the trilogy.  The slow, methodical development of the mysteries is nicely counterbalanced by the tempestuous relationship that develops between Julia and Brisbane.  The writing is elegant and rich, and it was a real pleasure to immerse myself in it.The omnibus contains all three books in the trilogy:SILENT IN THE GRAVE - This introduces us to our heroine, Lady Julia Grey, and begins with her husband's murder.  As the winning first line of the novel tells us: ""To say that I met Nicholas Brisbane over my husband's dead body is not entirely accurate. Edward, it should be noted, was still twitching upon the floor.""  Julia had been quiet, obedient, and dull all her life - the freedom of widowhood sparks a journey of self-discovery.  When Julia realizes her husband was murdered, more than a year after he died, she is determined to find the killer - no matter how cold the trail.  To succeed, she needs the help of Nicholas Brisbane, the private investigator her late husband hired before his death to investigate a series of ominous threats.SILENT IN THE SANCTUARY - This second book takes place at the family seat in Sussex, a converted abbey in the dead of winter.  The novel is richly atmospheric - a holiday party is trapped inside the fantastical gothic structure during a terrible snowstorm.  One among them is murdered, and another must be the culprit.  There are gypsies, ghosts roaming the stone-flagged halls, secret passages, impecunious relatives and a talking raven named Grim.  But SILENT IN THE SANCTUARY turns these gothic cliches on their heads as Julia and Brisbane race against time to find the murderer before the snow melts.SILENT IN THE MOORS - Like the second book, this one picks up - and transforms - a cliche: a dark, ominous, half-ruined estate in the northern moors of Yorkshire, capped by a rotting manor house, where dark family secrets fester.  Brisbane has acquired the estate, and his letters back to London indicate that something is very wrong - although he won't say exactly what.  Julia makes the journey north to investigate her relationship with Brisbane, and provide what help she can.  She's soon caught up in a proper mystery, featuring a family of aristocrats ruined by pride and a pair of mummified corpses hidden in a monk's hole.I devoured the trilogy.  The atmosphere of each book is wonderfully distinct and Raybourn does a wonderful job setting the scene - it's full of rich period detail, and everyone has a story to tell.  The whole cast of characters is magnificent, including every single member of Julia Grey's rather large family - she's one of ten children.  Although I sometimes solved the whodunit a little early in the story, Raybourn usually isn't content with just one crime: there's usually a tangle of them, and always had to wait for the end to see every detail unraveled.Brisbane is a dark, dangerous, mysterious sort of hero - easy to fall for, but terribly frustrating.  Sexy as he is, at times I really wondered if he was worth the trouble.  The romance is stretched out over all three volumes, and Julia and Brisbane's relationship is at least nominally professional - readers will be panting after the cracks in their professional facade.  At the end of the day, I still wished Brisbane had been a little warmer - and I am usually a big fan of brusque, brooding heroes.I started the trilogy expecting something along the lines of Dorothy Sayers, but the homage was really towards the Bronte sisters, Gothic mysteries, and maybe a dash of Sherlock Holmes.  All in all, highly recommended.","10 15, 2009",AXHEVH3H93VV7,Erin Satie,1255564800

I found it to be very jarring to be jerked out of the story like that.  I definitely enjoy when an author takes the time to set the scene, but I think in this case, it just goes a little too far.I found I had the easiest time following the story when I just scanned through the overly descriptive parts to get a sense of the setting and then picked up the story in between.

I hadn't known or had forgotten that Salem was so called as a reference to the New Jerusalem.  He also does a fine job of mapping out the geography of the colony and the underlying land issues that were at stake as factions jockeyed for power using the ""witchcraft"" card.  His biblical references evoke the times and the underlying religious imperatives of the different colonies and the role of the clergy.Less successful for me was the romance, a little too on-the-nose for my taste with characters talking to themselves and each other in soap opera speeches.  However, the lead character - a young barrister in training enlisted as a spy by Cotton Mather is compelling.

Even after 500 years these lovers still can't get enough sex or go without seeing each  other and nothing and no one else matters unless they can be together. It's supposed to be 'love conquers all' but here sex masquerading as love conquers all. These two need no one but each other and when together it's always becomes sex. This writer once again has a theme or concept that she fails to develop. It could be erotica except that the writer introduces too much into the story that separates a couple who don't want to be parted. They had been a team in the past but could not be so in the present nor was there any evidence of  what changes occurred in the world to which she could adapt but he could not. With more information about what was going on in the world that required her return other than a promise, the reader could understand her mission and perhaps see one for him as well. We're not given anything to work with that is developed enough to make sense even in a fantasy world. The characters not only remain the same physically for 500 years but they don't grow in intelligence or understanding of each nor the world around them. It's about sex that is only fulfilling at the moment and must constantly be repeated without loss of any passion or perception that they are not alone and may be needed else where. The 'Elders' seem to be nothing more that mythical gods who can't be pleased for long. Forever is no time at all to these people and life has no meaning that the writer shares with the reader. Trite!

Freak City is a much darker story than the first, and the characters have less charm.  I thought that Argus-as-a-child (from the 1st book) had great potential, but it would seem that he did not live up to it - though there are hints at the very end that things may change.The storyline was good, and the puzzle that Argus set out to solve was intriguing, but I also get the feeling that the author may have lost his grip on the story somewhat.  I won't provide spoilers, but there was one comment made at the beginning of the story that was never mentioned again - and to me, it seemed that that was the crux of the whole story.  I kept waiting for Argus to put two and two together and remember that comment, but it never happened.  Instead the characters danced around that issue without it ever coming to the fore (where I think it belonged).  This is supposed to be Book 2 of a trilogy, so perhaps the author intended it to 'lead up to' the finale in the 3rd book.All in all, a good little book (very short, probably novella length) with an interesting cast of characters.  It's definitely Number Two in a series, so readers should start with Snapdragon Alley in order to pick up the background.Note on Kindle formatting:  Perfect, or nearly so.

I loved that this particular dragon was an oldie with specific ideas on how he was going to go about claiming his human mate, only to have it all go to pot once he found her.  Living through his frustration, all while seeing his extreme enjoyment, was quite amusing.In this book, I was a bit surprised that there wasn't a super baddie to be fought off, run from, protect against, as ie usually the way. After all, a good story has to have an antagonist/adversary right?  Without giving away key aspects of the story, I will simply say that in this story, the threat was not against his mate but rather someone she cared about.  Even with that, I have to say the threat was not much & I was left somewhat disappointed in how that part of the story was handled. To me that's part of the story I usually enjoy, so having it lacking left me feeling kind of uh.For the most part I consider this a good addition to the series.  It is certainly not my favorite of the series thus far, and was more sex and ""me dragon, you mine,"" than it was an actual completely written story, but it was enjoyable.Given that the books are all character continuation (the same characters connect throughout the series in one way or another), I would recommend starting at the first book in the series.  This certainly can be read as stand-alone, but I think the entire concept will be much more thoroughly enjoyed (some of the characters, their abilities, their mates familiar) if read in reading order.I have already started the next in the series, ""Conner's Wolf,"" and I am hopeful that Jory will get back on track with a great villain, good plot and engaging story as she has thus far with the Supernatural Bonds Series.

My friend's family and mine share a common interest in the Appalachian Mountains, especially the area where BLIND MALICE takes place.  We vacation together for a week each summer on the Blue Ridge Parkway.Jackson paints a realistic and colorful portrait of the Appalachian Mountains while the main character, Rachel Myers, after living in Arizona for many years, reaquaints herself with the area where she was born and grew up.Isaac Starling, an old family friend, self-sufficient, independent, and stoic, embodies the spirit of the pioneers who settled that area over two hundred years ago.One has to believe that it is that same tenacious pioneer spirit that causes Rachel to sink her teeth into the mystery surrounding her father's death and hang on until she finds the truth.  Myers had me cheering for her all the way because she seems such a real person.A sub-theme in BLIND MALICE is how tourism, as it continues to increase, is affecting both the culture and the physical mountains, something we can see first hand each summer.BLIND MALICE is an enjoyable murder-mystery with an exciting plot.  The ending is superbly unexpected!","11 17, 2009",A1F4GT5CZEU1I6,Reacher2,1258416000

I saw Holiday Bound recommended by Amazon in their free Kindle ebooks section and thought it would be perfect to start my Christmas reading.I found the premise interesting but unfortunately due to length issues Beth Kery did not explore the subject as thoroughly as I would have liked.Alex is an interesting and layered character (as layered as one can be in such a short novella), thankfully Beth Kery spends enough time to give us details about his background with his father so that the reader understands the complexity and problemacy of their relationship.However, somehow Beth Kery forgot about Angeline along the way and left her standing there without giving us some depth into how a woman who has been going out for 2 months with a man can after only spending a couple of hours together with that man's son sleep with him based on physical, sexual attraction. And even later, once her hormones subside, we don't get too much of a glimpse into the workings of Angeline's mind and feelings .My other complaint is the ending of the novel, I found it too improbable and a clich&eacute;, and I missed that after the big showdown between Mitch, Alex and Angeline nothing was resolved: neither Mitch and Alex, or Alex and Anegline or Angeline and Mitch spoke about the problem and what to do about the situation!Verdict: But overall the attraction between Alex and Angeline is sizzling, and the dominating yet protective alpha maleness of Alex will make anyone feel hot and bothered. A nice short book to read by the fire on a cold winter night.The cover is a great representation of the book, so you know what to expect when starting it: Holiday Bound is a sparkly festive, sexy and saucy story :-)Plot: 8/10Characters: 7/10Ending: 6/10Writing: 8/10Cover: 9/10","11 25, 2010",A1JVLHI56QJF5V,Stella (Ex Libris),1290643200

7992,B0035LDMZ6,"[2, 2]",3,"After reading 'Knowing Caleb' which I absolutely loved, I decided to explore more of this author's work. ReneCade didn't impress the way the first book did. I had a few problems. Ren and Cade come together fairly early in the book which was fine, but then the sex got repetitive and plot took a backseat for a few chapters.  Ren and Cade were interchangeably strong and insecure/needy, sometimes all within a matter of sentences.  Sometimes I couldn't figure exactly what they were angsting over as the conclusion they would draw from each other's actions didn't seem logical. The angst just seemed to be fabricated and drawn out for no good reason.  Cade's inability/unwilligness to forgive Ren's transgression, or even accept a portion of the blame, did not endear me to him.  Why he needed six months to forgive and fully commit to Ren after a) being so distraught when he thought Ren was hurt, b) having Ren wait on him hand and foot after HE was hurt, and c) after the scene with Ren's mother, was just beyond my comprehension and absolutely ridiculous.As far as characters went, I couldn't really get a handle on each of their personalities. With the exception of Cade being 'by the book' and a neat freak, they were pretty interchangeable emotionally, especially in the bedroom.Speaking of the bedroom (or anywhere else they had sex), I have never in my life seen characters talk as much during sex as this author's.  It bugged me slightly in ""Knowing Caleb"" but she really went to town here. I'm not talking post-coital pillow talk. I'm talking full fledged paragraphs of dialogue during the act. In one scene Cane actually orgasmed while Ren was still talking and I had to laugh because umm yeah, I don't need your damn life history!  Actually it's not just during sex, reading some of the dialogue will leave you breathless; there is just too much dialogue lumped together in one go. It just didn't feel natural.  And much of what they said was so flowery, I had to keep looking at the cover to remember that they were supposed to be men and not simpering schoolgirls.There were parts of the book that I did like and I actually cared for the characters, but surprisingly not the couple I was supposed to. I had a real soft spot for Ren/Tex. IMO, even though they were 'just' best friends and their sexual relationship was unbalanced in the beginning, they grew as individuals and were the only people who truly loved each other unconditionally. The fact that they had to go their separate ways to appease their respective spouses spoke volumes, both about their relationshp and the relationships they had with their spouses. At least Cane recognized that there was something very wrong with that.All in all this is an ok read.  I put it down a few times mostly because of Cade whom I truly rooted for in the beginning but who the author made unlikeable.  There are some strong points but this isn't a book I'll be reading again...or one I would recommend. Instead, I would suggest the following (also by Cameron Dane) -1) Knowing Caleb2) A Fostered Love3) Grey's Awakening (Cabin Fever)","05 5, 2011",AS4402KIX1B34,Nile Princess,1304553600

The plain,  spinsterish young woman from Massachusetts has come to claim the inheritance left to her by her aunt, but what exactly that inheritance entails is rather vague.  Gardiner's sheriff, Adam Caldwell, wastes no time in setting Rebecca straight:  She is now the new ""Madam"" of the town's only house of ill repute.  Since Rebecca is clearly not Madam material and Adam could really use a wife, the solution seems simple - Adam proposes.  But after years of taking care of her overbearing father Rebecca is in no hurry to tie herself to yet another man who is just looking for someone to cater to his every whim.  So Rebecca decides to try her new life on for size, and assumes the persona of ""Miss Becky"".  There's just one little problem...Miss Becky can't seem to resist the town's  temperamental sheriff, and Adam prefers plain old Rebecca to her flashier alter ego.I'm always singing Shannon Stacey's praises, but I felt kind of neutral about this one.  I found these characters very one dimensional.  Rebecca's lightening fast transformation from nave and virginal to faux-prostitute was really ridiculous, and the running joke about Adam just needing to shoot someone to blow off some steam got old real fast.  The whole story is very reminiscent of those cheesy, campy western movies and television programs that were so popular in the late 60's/early 70's.  I can almost picture the silly costumes and the fake looking scenery!  Wait!  Do I hear the theme music from Bonanza playing in the background?  I just know that Hoss and Little Joe are around her somewhere...While this one wasn't a good ""fit"" for me, there's no denying that the author really does write quite well.  The pacing is good and the dialog is nicely done.  I think the key to enjoying this is to go into it knowing what you're going to get:  a very light, fluffy romance that's historical in name only.While this is a follow-up to another book set in Gardiner, Texas -Taming Eliza Jane, you won't be lost if you don't read them in order.Occasional strong language and some sexual content.","01 4, 2012",A1XCSAX4BRT89Y,"L.

In the end, I found it didn't manage to avoid falling into those pitfalls, but I found I was pleased to have been introduced to the mythology of this world.This one was a little bit better than many novellas- the imagery is beautiful. Anyone who has spent time in a jungle would appreciate it. Very magical setting.The characters were not developed at all- I barely managed to put together a mental image of what they might look like, but the sex was hot and their attraction was palpable. Maggie and Brandt were likable enough, though you had to work hard to overlook his blatant deception that set off the whole thing. For the sake of the novella form, a reasonable back and forth between the two that would have allowed the relationship to develop had to be sacrificed. In places the passion short circuited rational thought, but Ms. Feehan managed to maintain the integrity of both characters.The best part of this, as I mentioned, was the mythology. Ms. Feehan has created a wonderful concept here. The environmental message was laid on a little thick, but overall it was a good concept to quickly win the heart of the reader.Anyone who is familiar with Ms. Feehan's work will recognize this isn't her best work, but it is a fast read that opens a door to a series that has great potential for passion.","09 5, 2010",AQNXEOJ4RPCGW,A.

I read the first few pages and thought I might might want to put it away, until I realized I was reading satire and a self-help book all-in-one.The book follows Beauty on her quest to turn her human, but sadly lacking husband back into the Beast who had won her heart before her marriage. Along the way, she meets other women who featured prominently in the Grimm Fairy Tales and listens to their tales of what happened Happily Ever After. Just like Anita Baker sang more than 20 years ago, fairy tales don't come true.Like many a woman who married because it was expected of her, or it was her duty, or she thought she could ""change"" him, these ladies share their stories of what went wrong, and finally, about what has made them happy.Along the way Beauty learns and grows, and like every good fairy tale, there is a moral to the story: instead of trying to change everyone around her and her circumstances to become what she wants, Beauty does the only possible thing she can do to make herself happy: she becomes what she needs instead of relying on somebody else to do it for her. It was a glorious end, and finally does credence to the line ""fairy tales can come true"".","04 20, 2012",A1SPR01CXDWGRZ,Laurie Davis,1334880000

Now, I don't know if it's better this way because it would have been rather gruesome, I think, or if it shows a lack of courage on the part of the author.In my opinion this book lacks a bit of depth and I don't know if it would have benefited from some editing out or from a few more pages of character development. When the writer went into the feelings of the protagonists, I really liked the story and the last pages, where Neil had to go over a difficult moment (I don't want to spoil it for you), were really emotional, because I could relate to him and his suffering.

Similar to book 1 in that this is a FAST read. Given that, it is pretty satisfying. Good book to read in an afternoon if you just want a little relaxing fun. It would almost be as comforting as a good cup of tea... or is it the other way around?Characters are sweet- more sweet than sexy in this case. Both Missy and Tad come across as people you'd like to have living next door. Despite the fact that I wasn't drooling over them or caught up in their passion, their romance was well done. There was some background between the two which helped provide some depth and their sexual tension was fun to watch unfold. I chuckled in places and sighed in contentment in others.This series does seem a little light on the paranormal side- you don't really get to spend too much time on the shifting or their nature as wolves, but pack politics come into play- and certainly wolf instincts. This book had a bit more magic in it given that the Omega wolf was a key part of the plot.All in all, it's a light, uncomplicated paranormal romance series. Something to read for fun when you have time. It is light and romantic enough to be soothing. I will save the next one for a day when I need a little escape.FURTHER READING: if you like this, you'll like...Moira Rogers' basic werewolf romance series:Cry Sanctuary: Book 1 of Red Rock Pass seriesR.G.

I felt so disconnected to the characters. I ended up rushing through because it was so annoying. I would not recommend this book. The hero constantly says he just feels lust for his WIFE. He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE, you are MARRIED, you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating. Then she walks out and he does not come after her but one word and a crook of the finger and there she goes running to him.

People must barter for anything and something only belongs to you so long as you can keep someone else from stealing it. We watch as Elysia tries to steal some food using stealth and some hidden ability to not be seen. Darien watches from the crowd horrified that the woman he's been looking for is about to be killed. They help each other escape Baltimore on a boat and learn about their difficult past together. As they work towards going into the wilderness, they finally find out how to trust each other and then they meet their spirit guide who takes them to others who've answered the call to find a new way to live.This story is fast paced with chapters that are only a few pages long.

Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: This little book  is #1 of the paranormal romance/erotica series ""Cougar Falls"" that features a variety of shifters. There is really only one thing that will influence how much you will enjoy this book- assuming you generally enjoy this genre in the first place: Would you find a m&eacute;nage encounter between one sexy lady and three hot brothers erotic? That is the only question to ask yourself. If you find your curiosity piqued or you KNOW you would, then read this. If not, then move on to something else.Reading order in the series:Rachel's TotemIn Plain SightFoxy LadyCHARACTERS: All these characters are sweet and sexy. It's a quirky little town with quirky people. This is a FAST read, so not a lot of development. I was actually surprised at how well the entire town was depicted in such a short book. While no one was fully developed, I got a good sense of the character of the place.PLOT: Again, this is a novella in a genre known for keeping things simple. Not a big plot line here- but for what it is, it's well done. It is definitely more creative than most I've read and opens up a world of possibilities for future books. All told, brilliant execution through simplicity.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended if you are up for some erotically messy f/m/m/m- no BSDM or m/m. This book is what it is and either you'll have fun with it or you won't.RECOMMENDATIONS: (some of these are more erotic than others...)1.

9895,B002E7ARKK,"[0, 0]",2,"I was drawn to this novel by the rather ""daring"" factor that the author had chosen a disabled protagonist - in this case, a deaf girl. Aside from that, it was a pretty disappointing read, going swiftly downhill. The relationships between Robyn and the wolf brothers was too sudden, especially her attraction to Kail - there was no doubt in her mind, not even any sort of inner cautionary voice - no, the moment she saw him she literally turned into an uninhibited sex fiend. As for his poor brother... TJ's sole presence in the book was to be made a mockery of and treated as if he were some sort of clowning duffus to be gotten ridden of as soon as things got a little hot and heavy between the two protagonists. And even then - when her brother finds out the truth - it turns out he knew all along! And don't get me started on the sex scenes! Actually, do get me started. They were NOT SEXY. Do we really need descriptions of body parts? And oh, he's so well hung - well what a surprise - aren't all male protagonists? And I hate, hate, hate the word ""milked"". Please. No. Not when you're discussing sex. It's just... gross.This novel read like a pale shadow of a Nalini Singh book. The concepts were almost the same, the sexual tension similar (although Arend did not draw that out nearly enough for it to be particularly steamy). But, of course, with one major difference. Singh is a good author.And sexual tension not withstanding - there was no actual action tension either. The characters hardly seemed to be at risk for their life, and I think this was just someone's wolf fantasy.Oh, and what happened to the big fight? The actual ritualistic fight for alpha wolf. It just never happened - the story just finished! 13% from the end of the ebook, I was quite surprised.Arend, perhaps your work gets better as you go along.

That's how he meets Micah. Micah is his mate, the person fate has destined for him, and Thomas naturally feels an irresistible attraction to him. Thomas makes love to him, claims him by biting him (cementing the mating bond), and convinces Micah to come back to his ranch with him. He figures he'll explain the whole ""werewolf"" thing later.On the road back though, they're accosted by gay bashers. When you're human, you really don't want to threaten a werewolf's mate, and Thomas soon as them beaten silly. When a neighboring pack is called in to do cleanup and discredit the bashers, the sheriff, Caleb, turns out to be a werewolf, an Alpha of his own pack, and *also* recognizes Micah as his mate. It turns out Micah is a tri-omega, a rare Omega werewolf that has *two* mates. Caleb doesn't want to share, Thomas doesn't either but realizes he must, and the three head back to Caleb's pack to try to form a trinity together.My problem with the story is that Caleb is a total jerk. He has little to no empathy for Micah. When Micah gets frustrated and overwhelmed with emotion from the negative feelings pack members give him, he leaves the house against Caleb's orders, and Caleb makes it clear to him that if he ever disobeys him again, he'll take it as a personal challenge. A challenge to a werewolf is a fight to the death. So in essence, Caleb is telling Micah that he's to stay and obey him... or die. Hardly loving and worthy of having mate. I felt Thomas should have been appalled at that behavior. Even though they're both mated to Micah, he should have been quick to jump and let Caleb know that he would never allow Caleb to threaten him. Thomas is a mate too and will fight to the death to protect his mate. He should have made Caleb realize that Micah was basically uprooted from his entire life and is now being treated as a prisoner, of course it's going to take some adjustment time. And even if they're werewolves with their own, they also live in modern society and are not foreign to the concept of individual's rights. Eventually, everything works out, but the bad taste left in my mouth from such boorish and threatening behavior from Caleb marred an otherwise totally enjoyable story.Still, if you've read the other Wolf Creek Pack and Tri-Omega series, it's worth it to read this one too. It does have some very romantic and sexy qualities, and there's many good moments.","06 12, 2010",A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP,"Robert Carnevali ""Typical, middle-aged guy""",1276300800

Sociopaths have no conscience, no sympathy and no empathy.  Thus, when they are describing their acts to us (or their victims) it is gonna be ugly.  And this is ugly in many of the things done.  However, I was not shocked or offended (even though I admit it was pretty gory and graphic).This book tells the tales of two people - one who picks up hitchhikers and one who hitchhikes. And a couple of people they encounter along the way to meeting up.I just was put off by the feeling of contrivance related to the ending.

Second, Two accepted that she was a vampire far too quickly - I didn't buy that either.  The main problem I had with this book was the lack of emotional depth.

I just couldn't get over the fact that the relationship didn't seem real to me.  I wish I could have because I think the direction this writer was going in as far as vampire lore was fascinating.

He doesn't dare tell her. He knows her too well. Whenever it comes to deep emotion, Dana keeps everyone at arms length. Playing, however, is her forte, and one night when a storm has taken out the power on the street they live on, Jake walks across to check on her, only to find her and her boyfriend in the back yard in an intimate situation. Dana comes off the porch to stand in the rain in front of him, and her entreaty is too much to resist. Ignoring his possessive nature and his dislike of her casual boyfriend Mason, he gives in to the woman he loves and joins them.Dana knows that Mason is just a good time, that Jake is forever, but she's just interested in playing, enjoying her sexuality now that she has two men who will share her. She plays with them both, unconcerned, until one encounter with Jake changes her life. When you know you're going to be a mother, you start to realize either  playtime is over...or you have to start playing for keeps. And telling Jake and Mason takes that to a whole other level.What started out as a relatively simple menage a trois erotica romance novella with Walker's classic intense romantic angst takes a turn after that and becomes a much more serious and emotionally powerful and poignant story of love and unspeakable loss. I have nothing against the first part, really, but it lacked a bit in depth and character development for my tastes. The second part was so intense, however, and the emotions so vibrant and real as Jake and Dana try to survive a tragedy that shakes them to the soul, that it utterly eclipsed the beginning and made it seem shallow.I can't say I enjoyed the second part - it was very dark for the genre - but it was very well written and felt very emotionally honest. I have to give Walker credit for the courage and strength to write something so personally devastating. I also have to admit I loved the end and appreciated the hope and joy and promise that was reintroduced.

Basically Maxine is receiving some harassing phone calls and then vandalism and Ryan believes she is in dangers.

True, if he was anything else it probably wouldn't be an interesting read, however, It would have been nice to see a more Alpha woman...if that makes any more sense.

I was never left confused or having to re-read something. I did enjoy seeing a more independent woman who didn't want to be a burden to the people in her life. The story line was a little predictable and I wish that authors for this genre in general would write more in depth plots with more twists and turns to provide a more adrenalin filled novel that goes along with the romance.View more of my review and others at my blog: [...]","07 20, 2012",A2FC3XQY0SWISM,"Jetches ""Jetches (My Not So Vacant Shelf)""",1342742400

Although they heated up the sheets, their short lived liaison was more notable for the fighting. Now, months later, Soleil is noticeably pregnant and still in semi denial. A child had never been in her game plan. Added to that, she is struggling with exactly how to (whether to) tell West. He is a Special Forces officer in the Air Force and has been back at his base in Colorado since their last and, as it turns out, most consequential encounter.But surprise! West has come back to town to take care of his father who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and he runs into a Soleil who has some explaining to do.After I read this book I was both very impressed and profoundly disappointed. I think my disappointment comes from the fact that this was a nice read, but there was a great read struggling to get out. There was so much here that the reader could sink their teeth into and, unfortunately, none of it got the treatment it deserved.This book touched on the following: political identity & idealism, divorce, single parenthood v. marriage, how children view their parents and vice/versa, the ways in which children internalize parental expectations, and how love works with all of these.I think the cover of the book is so incredibly misleading. It is not some bubbly tale of a secret baby. Soleil's pregnancy and her reconnection with West is the main story, but the subplots and secondary characters are very vital and interesting in the story and are much deeper than the cover implies. And therein lies my biggest problem. I was incredibly engrossed in West's struggle with dealing with the twin blows of impending fatherhood and the fact that his larger than life father was going through terrifying bouts of dementia. I was equally drawn in by Julia's, West's mother's, re-entry into the dating world (she and West's father have been divorced for many years) and the wonderful new guy she meets. And I was incredibly intrigued by the very prickly, yet fascinating relationship Soilel has with her famous, idiosyncratic mother. BTW, I loved Soleil's background -- her hippie, down with the establishment middle class white-bread mother becomes a radical and hooks up with a Black Panther who himself later becomes establishment thereby dooming that relationship. Lol. Soleil's mother is a One woman character play waiting to happen.SO when the book ends with only West and Soleil's relationship sewn up, I felt like I was cut adrift. Even the resolution of West and Soleil's relationship wasn't completely satisfactory. It seemed so incredibly rushed. The two of them were coming from fundamentally different places. I never felt the two of them came together adequately for each other. Sure they pledge their love, but it is a Harlequin, you expect that. I didn't completely feel it. Don't get me wrong, the author creates a great connect between the two but she really needed more pages to explore it more.And that is the crux of the issue for me. I think this book needed a good 100 to 200 more pages to really satisfy me. The writing here was very good and the characters were excellent. I simply needed more time with them.","05 30, 2012",A2GO2DPX0E1NFN,"T. Wheaton ""T.W.""",1338336000

The whole thing reads like a first draft.  Anders writes entirely too much in the passive voice so that things happen, but by hands or chins or thoughts and not by people.  Really, it's embarrassing that this text has been published!Here's some examples of what I'm talking about.  Twice the word ""sordid"" was written as ""sorted.""  At one point, Arabella ""shuttered"" when she should have ""shuddered.""  Victor waves a ""treacherous knife"" and Darth takes a ""languished puff"" off a cigar.

The terrible quality of the writing and editing here jerked me out of the dream repeatedly.  What's the point of a book so bad you just laugh at it, the author, and the publisher?

Adam will give and do anything for his daughter and right now no matter what it cost he is willing to pay to make his daughter walk again.Jaden NEEDS the money and not for the reason that Adam thinks, but Jaden is prepared to put up with Adams low impression of her to get her hands on the money. The money is only part of the problem because once Jaden meets Adam's little girl, who just happens to not be a little girl, but a mouthy little brat with lots of issues she was lost and was prepared to work her hardest to make this young lady walk again.From then on Ms. Nicholas had two storyline running alongside each other and while the romance between Adam and Jaden didn't hold me for very long -  I will say that it was not from lacking of trying on both their path. They were fun to be around and the sexual tension was pretty steaming between them.What held my interest in this book was the relationship between Adam's teenage daughter Emily and her father as well as her road to confidence with every step she takes and every new person that comes across her path..This was my first read by this author and it was no hardship to go with the flow of this story. Some of it felt a little too convenient but that took nothing away from the more positive aspects of the book.Adam's brother is one character that I fell totally in love with in this book and I do hope Ms. Nicholas give him his HEA very soon....","03 7, 2010",A3INJZFRZRELZI,E.H.

6000,B002CZQ7XK,"[0, 1]",3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book but it wasn't all that original.  The writing was good, which is something I've come to treasure in today's market, when anyone can publish their poorly written slop without much difficulty and even best selling authors from major publishing houses are suffering a lack of editing.  For that reason alone, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal/Gothic romance.If you're not looking for characters with depth or a plot with surprising twists, you'll probably enjoy this book.There were two things that I didn't like.  (SPOILER ALERT!)  First, the way the love scenes were written gave me the impression that this author isn't really comfortable writing about sex.  When the hero and heroine made love for the first time, the tone suddenly became weirdly formal, with lines like ""It seemed imperative that their bodies meet without hindrance..."" which sort of killed the mood for me.  There were also so many flagrant metaphors (""He stirred her...like waves of a storm""; ""They poised on the edge of a volcano..."") that I totally missed the ghostly elements during that scene because I thought it was just more metaphor.  It was only at the end of the scene, when the characters started talking about what had just happened, that I even understood what the author was trying to portray.Second, I'm a retired professional musician who also has a degree in psychology, and unfortunately, this author tried to portray both a musician character and a character who suffers mental problems without doing enough research into either area.  Most people who lack my background might not notice, but for me, these flaws were glaring.  I'm not certain how this author came up with her information, but it was both inaccurate and outdated.  I realize it's nerdy to expect writers to do a little basic research before they start typing, but this kind of sloppiness tends to ruin books for me.  I can handle a bit of poetic license, but this went beyond that, straight into the realm of lazy disregard for plausibility.One other complaint: most ebooks allow the reader to jump between chapters.  This one didn't, making it very difficult to move through the book if I wanted to go back and check something I'd read before--something I often do while reading a book which involves some sort of mystery.  This really annoyed me, more than the occasion errors in the formatting did.If you're not too picky and don't expect too much, you'll probably enjoy this book.

But soon after their arrival, Shane, his cousin Brad, and fellow camper Nicole begin to suspect that the people running the camp might be vampires.Overall I found Night Camp to be a cute and engaging story about the adventures of kids at a summer camp. It brought back lots of memories of my times at summer camp, and I found myself wishing that I too could have spent my summers living in a castle and exploring caves instead of the much more traditional cabins and canoeing that I remember. Of course, I was also grateful that I was not entirely cut off from adults and the outside world while at the mercy of people who I suspected might want to use my blood as a midnight snack.Night Camp was written for a younger audience than what I usually review, and I sometimes had a difficult time putting myself in the mindset of a younger child. If I were to encounter a vampire, I would immediately try to determine which of the many vampire mythologies in fiction most closely resembled the creatures with which I was presented. But clearly the average 13-year-old does not have the experience or analytic capability to try to understand vampires on this level.

As others have noted, most of the characters came off as jerks--self centered jerks to be exact.  Because there were so many ""main characters"" each one's ""romance"" was given no time at all.  Seriously, I would definitely prefer one GOOD romance than 4 rushed jobs.  When you try to mish mash 4 romances together like this the characters are lost and the plot ceases to exist.This is billed as an ""Irish Romance,"" and I can only assume that is because everyone speaks like a bloody Irishman--despite the fact that only 2 of the characters are from Ireland.  If the author wants to make most of the characters American, then bloody well learn how they talk. The editing was poor but that takes a backseat to the lack of a plot and poorly developed and unlikeable characters.","02 16, 2012",A2SBNIQK0K5XDD,Lady ReadsaLot,1329350400

The general story could be any girls dream.  Hot construction crew next door remodeling a house, you've been drooling over not just one but all of them.  Turns out while they take breaks they ""relieve"" the stress from work by having s ex, and if there just isn't a woman around, that's not a problem.  They can take care of each other.Then enter Kate.  She's a little shy to start but she quickly jumps on that bandwagon.  A lot quicker than I would've thought considering the amount of guys she was taking on.  Because really, sometimes one isn't enough, and just two can be boring.I'll admit that at times I was a bit confused as to who's thing was going where (hey, there's too many to keep track of!) but every sex scene was hot! And for such a short story, there was a lot of it!But then there is also romance.  Although she is with the whole crew there was an attraction and connection with Mike.  I felt that wasn't developed as much, especially being a short story that can be hard.  But I did like Mike.  He's very alpha, as most of the guys.I am looking forward to continuing this series because this crew and their powertools are just HOT!","07 31, 2012",A1JKGTL51HHTU1,Under The Covers Book Blog,1343692800

Being human allows Kelly to handle the business during the day, but she still finds herself working a lot at night.  That's when she mostly encounters the frustrating Master vampire, Marc LaTour, who has moved in while having his own home renovated.  Marc is sexy and appeals to Kelly like no other, but she must keep her distance, because she doesn't want to end up just another meal.  Marc loves Kelly's quick wit and attitude.  She draws him like a moth to a flame.  When a threat to Kelly is revealed, he must protect her and keep her safe.  Kelly and Marc struggle to learn what they mean to each other, but in the end Fate always has her way.Rare Vintage is Book 2 in Bianca D'Arc's Brotherhood of the Blood series.

I really love this description because it makes it clear that the book is about a group of close-knit friends. The thing I loved about `Twenty-Somewhere' is that it's set right after the girls (Sophie, Claudia and MJ) graduate from college. I haven't read that many books that take place during this time, so that made it interesting for me. Hoffman did a good job describing the girls' feelings as they deal with new homes, new jobs, new loves, and just a whole lot of new situations.While I really loved the concept (and even the plot) of the book, I had a hard time with the style of writing. For some reason the present tense really threw me off, and I had a hard time differentiating between characters at first. I never really felt like I got to know the characters all that well, perhaps because of the third person narration, but also because of the abundance of dialogue. The lack of lengthy descriptions and the short section breaks make `Twenty-Somewhere' easy to read and kept me turning the pages, but it also kept me from feeling totally involved with the characters.As this book won the St. Martin's Press ""New Adult"" contest it's clear that it has a lot of potential. If you're looking for something quick and easy to read that also contains humour and heartache, then `Twenty-Somewhere' might be for you. This book covers a topic which could be pretty heavy, but Kristan makes it light and funny, having her characters find strength in their new situations.","11 1, 2011",A3VB6DM761644D,Ashley @ Book Labyrinth,1320105600

I'm going to do my best not to include any spoilers, but I'm definitely going to be referencing some stuff that happens later in the book because I could see where things were headed by the time I was halfway through the book.For the first third of the book we have this AWESOME chemistry between Rori and Jude and then I get to cheer for her because she refuses to be treated like a piece of meat, the way Jude normally treats his women.  Seriously, what's with these other chicks that they're totally okay jumping him that afternoon and then seeing him out on a date with Rori that evening and then go so far as to proposition him in front of her?  Although at least that gave Rori the heads up that no matter how hot Jude is in bed, she deserves a better MAN outside of it.Enter Zach... hurrah!  Rori's biggest sexy time connection with Jude was that she discovered she's submissive and she was really turned on by his dominant side.  Zach is yet another sexy dominant who is smitten with Rori, but Zach has no problem being an amazing, romancing relationship guy.  I totally started to fall for him and then I remembered that this book is called ""Second Chances"" and that the blurb mostly talks about Jude.At which point I start going oh eff no, because Zach is too possessive for this to be a sharing book.Suffice to say, figuring out halfway through the book exactly how Jude was going to be positioned to get a second chance, and then having his second chance with Rori being RUSHED through the last third of the book, I did not come away satisfied.  There's not enough time spent on Jude's reformation and there's not enough connection between him and Rori to satisfy me.  I felt the strongest connection with Zach and yet we already know before reading that that relationship isn't ultimately going anywhere, which makes it really hard to get invested in it.By the time I got to the last third of the book I was really emotionally detached from everything that was going on because I couldn't connect with Zach anymore and I didn't want to connect again with Jude, who had been such an a$$ throughout 2/3 of the book.Dane's written much better stuff.  Honestly, I can't recommend this one.  I'd try one of her other titles unless you've already bought everything else she has to offer and absolutely MUST read every single thing she's ever written.","07 1, 2013",AH3W1BMSY9G07,Lovemuffins,1372636800

An easy read as Robyn and Keil find each other and make themselves a life together. It is short, but it's also part of a series. You see, while it technically stands alone, it comes to a rather abrupt ending. We get a whole lot of World Definition, some hot sex, a return to civilisation, and then it ends. But that ending is picked up during the next book, so we see how Robyn and Keil are getting on, from a slightly different perspective. An interesting technique which will polarise readers, but works for me. (And since Arend also published the two books in paperback, possibly indicative of a greater plan). A good read with clever characters and an interesting use of telepathy.-CR-","04 26, 2012",A1ZN2JLLR9GI3T,cathyr,1335398400

She couldn't believe her husbands (yes plural) Logan Wellesly and Rhys Cullen had stood her up again.  The night she was going to share the news that they were going to be parents.  To make matters worse when they did call, instead of apologizing for standing her up, they were canceling the 2 week vacation they had planned.  She was tired of pretending that their marriage wasn't a mess; she thought this vacation was their last chance to get it back on track - and they canceled.  So she was going without them...she figured they wouldn't even notice that she was gone.Two days after she arrived in Jamaica, Rhys finds her dancing in a club.  He takes her back to his hotel room, where a few minutes later Logan shows up, and he seems surprised that she left without a note or phone call.

And for my first, I thought that I would dive right in with the horror/thriller story, Serial, by Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn (aka JA Konrath).Goodreads description:Remember the twin golden rules of hitchhiking?#1: Don't go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.#2: Don't pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be raving nutcase.So what if, on some dark, isolated road, Crazy #1 offered a ride to Crazy #2...This story was a short, quick read, written in a very unique way. According to the info at the back of the book, Kilborn and Crouch each built their killer, and their killer's pre-story before sharing what they had with one another. Then, they collaborated and finished it up together. Sounds sweet, huh?It's anything but sweet. As far as stories about kindred souls finding each other go, this one was dark as all hell. Even in such a short format, Crouch and Kilborn are able to stick you into the warped minds of their characters, and make you never want to be on the side of the road again. It's gory and perverted and definitely not for people with queezy stomachs.I give it umm... (wow, hadn't thought of a rating system so I guess I'll be generic for now) 5 Stars. I was hooked from page one, Serial is well written and the characters grabbed my attention. I would recommend Serial for anyone that wants a quick and bloody read.I wish it was longer, but to be fair, there is a longer story out there, Serial Uncut, that I haven't picked up yet.

This type of material really needs to be in a category other than ""romance"". Describing it as ""erotica"" is very much a misnomer considering how poorly developed the characters are, how non-existent the story line is and how desperately the writer needs to expand her vocabulary.

I consider myself a Christian, but was not raised in any particular ""religion""- as a result, I only have the Bible to go on, where it is repeatedly said that the Jews are Gods Chosen people... I can't imagine that has changed. God is not fickle. Is God going to refuse the Jewish people, who also love and serve Him? If I thought that were possible than maybe He isn't a God I want to serve...As long as anyone is condemning someone else for having a different belief system than their own, we are doomed to repeat history. There are many paths to God. It makes me cringe when any one religion claims theirs' is the ONLY way. We need to embrace each other, as equal children of God, and remember that the Greatest Commandment is LOVE. Who are we to judge another?I highly recommend this book.

2722,B00436EZGC,"[33, 41]",2,"First off, though the initial blurb sounded interesting, the premise is actually totally implausible and the author does nothing to make it easier to swallow.  In just three years, Ethan starts up a tech company that revolutionizes the industry and makes billions?  Not only that, he finds time to buy an island and lay this intricate trap for David that involves earning frequent flyer miles, locks on every kitchen cabinet and door, and printed resort brochures?  In three years?  Maybe in eight or ten years, but three??The premise could have really benefited by having these guys be more than three years out of college, with some life and love experience behind them.All of that aside, most of the conflict is a plot device.  Sure, David ran off on Ethan when he was caught masturbating while watching his best friend shower.  And David's cowardice is the grounds for a great deal of hurt.  But at no time - either in the past or present - does Ethan speak up about his feelings for David, instead letting David assume this now is all a petty revenge scheme.  If either Ethan or David had the least bit of emotional depth, I could have bought the conflict.  But we never see a reason for David to fear being hurt or rejected by Ethan, nor do we get anything that would make us think Ethan wouldn't confess his love for David.  Instead, Ethan acts like a smug jerk, and David is so busy running away from everything that he just seems weak and whiney.  Beyond that, these characters have the emotional depth of a teaspoon between them; the author gives us very little reason to care about them or their relationship.And then later in the story, there comes a point when David lies to get them off the island, and his lies are more convoluted and cruel than if he had just admitted the truth and promised to work on a future with Ethan (if he was able to convince Ethan of the lie, making him believe the truth would have been WAY easier).  Instead, this leads to more separation and hurt feelings and contrived plot devices.  It was all very frustrating and I found myself skipping ahead to the end.And worst of all, the sex wasn't very hot, even with the titillating inclusion of bits of bondage.  I'm still not sure how Ethan ever thought that David was a submissive when it came to sex; I guess it's just lucky he was right.Save your money and skip this one, no matter how interesting the plot sounds.","10 25, 2010",A17CRGVACWUFMN,Amazon Customer,1287964800

He's desperate and this leads him to a decision he never thought he'd have to make, to become a rent boy at the local all-male brothel, the Chicken Ranch. Killian Hamilton is a 30 year old accountant. He is good looking and successful at his profession but social awkwardness keeps him lonely. He avoids dating so a drive out to the rural brothel that he just heard about seems like an easy way to satisfy his sexual needs. His visit happens to occur on Declan's first night of work and he is the one who takes Dec's virginity, although Killian doesn't know this at the time. This was a one-time occurrence. Months pass and Declan becomes good at his job but he never means to make this a career. He begins taking a few courses at the local community college. Miller returns to his lonely existence. Then the two happen to run into each other at a grocery store and they decide to meet outside the ranch in hopes of fostering a friendship that both need in their lives. An attraction is there and soon they are dating. Declan works hard to pull his life together and build a future away from prostitution. Killian steadfastly stands by his man being patient, understanding and loving--- all difficult to do in the face of his reality. I do find it a little hard to believe how little an impact on his life is the fact that Declan is a male prostitute. I mean of course it affected his relationship with Killian. Killian, who had little self-confidence to be begin with, struggled with the fact that Declan was constantly having sex with men who might be better than him in any and all departments. Jealousy is a real bitch to tame! But outside of this personal relationship, Declan went to work, went to school, went on with his life with no apparent repercussions from his type of employment. It just seems a little bizarre to me. Still, this is a fast, interesting read with flawed but oh-so-likeable characters who get their happy ending in a believable way. That's not an easy thing to say when discussing a male prostitute working at a place called the Chicken Ranch! Considering where Declan was in his life at the beginning of the story, the end is that much sweeter.

Or so she thinks.Antonio Villareal is every inch a Master.  His sexual exploits are legendary and Jane can attest that he's definitely a wonderful lover.  Only she hasn't fully experienced everything he's got to offer because he hasn't introduced her to his best friend Santos yet.  Antonio and Santos enjoy sharing a woman and Jane's about to experience being mastered by not one but two men.Jane and her best friend and business partner, Lily's company R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up the events this weekend. However, it's their extracurricular activities that are holding their attention.  Jane's caught up in her sexual encounter with Antonio and the new knowledge that he shares women with his best friend Santos.  She has to admit that it's a fantasy she enjoys but never seriously considered being in such a situation herself - until cornered by Antonio and Santos.Her friend Lily had her own sexual experience but her emotions are in a tizzy over the event.  Lily and Jean Jacques are strong minded individuals and he's definitely a Dominant male so the simple fact that she won't accept his dominance over her is going to cause all sorts of problems.  Jealousy, hurt, and a power struggle are at the forefront of their relationship.  Can they get past their need for control and admit to their feelings?I've reached the conclusion that Dominique Adair is a cruel woman - or maybe she just enjoys teasing us - in either case, she's definitely got me hooked with her JANE PORTER stories!  These stories capture your attention from the very beginning, build your anticipation, engage your emotions - and then you discover that you'll have to wait for the next story to find out what happens next - and believe me, you'll want to know what happens next.  These characters are highly memorable, the sex scenes are beyond hot and conversations are delightfully wicked.  I've got a real fondness for Jane, Antonio and Santos, but I have to confess it's Lily and Jean Jacques battle of wills that really holds my attention and makes `angry sex' so very appealing.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","08 10, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

1236,B001DOHZ5A,"[2, 2]",4,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBORDER LAIR is the second book in the Dragon Knights series. While I do believe that this book is strong as a standalone, Adora and Jared are introduced in MAIDEN FLIGHT and their romance really stems from there. This book takes on a different approach than the first book. I thought D'Arc really changed the tone of the series with this one. Things are far more bigger in this book - war is approaching and dark times are ahead.Unfortunately for Jared, his life has been in constant darkness since his wife and child died. His grief still lingers within him and he feels unworthy of Adora's love even though she is willing to give it freely. He deems himself undeserving and I think readers will be touched by Jared's gentle heart. Adora gentle coxes Jared out of his shell and slowly learns his ways. As their romance continues to bloom D'Arc really cements the fact that they are meant to be together, a third member is introduced. Lord Darian comes to warn them that death and destruction come their way and though he is seen as a traitor now, Jared welcomes his old friend. Darian takes an immediate interest in Adora and sparks fly between the two. However, as Darian is a member of the royal line of black dragons, Adora is aware that she cannot have something permanent with Darian even though she desperately wants to.D'Arc experiments with the mating rules and rituals she introduced in the first book and I liked seeing the happy ending at the end, but felt that the solution to the conflict seemed to happen too conveniently. I also felt that the romance was slightly impeded by Jared's hesitancy and seemed to fast-track too quickly after when he made the decision to be with Adora to make up for the time lost. Nevertheless, I was enraptured by D'Arc's world. Bringing together dragons, war and love, D'Arc is readily able to transport readers to another time, giving them an escape that they will sure to remember.The se x scenes, again, are very explicit but are well-done. D'Arc explores light bondage and m&eacute;na ge well and am always looking forward to seeing how she will bring three different people together for the purpose of love. She seems to do a stellar job each time.*ARC provided by publisher","09 25, 2012",A1JKGTL51HHTU1,Under The Covers Book Blog,1348531200

I was trying to figure out their ages, how the contest even started, etc.  Perhaps I missed that information when I read the book.I'd say since it's only $1.19, go and buy it because it may be your cup of tea.

His boyfriend, Jacob, is also a PsyCop, but he's the non-psychic half of a separate detective team in a different precinct. Vic rates as a level five medium (the scale goes to seven), and he's able to easily hear and see the spirits of the deceased who have not moved on yet. He also has a tendency to abuse his medications, but hey, if you kept seeing murders reenacted, you would too.""Secrets"" is a great read. We delve deeper into Vic like we never have before. His relationship with Jacob is being strained by both internal and external forces. He's being pressured to have a house-warming for his new place, but since he and Jacob aren't officially ""out"" on the force, he starts to more closely contemplate he and Jacob can or will be perceived by their peers. Also, he's come to discover that there's very little information about him on the Internet. None, actually. Someone, or some group, is going through great lengths to erase any mention of him anywhere.The characters are deep and complex. Victor's narration is addictive and compelling (and wittily sarcastic throughout). Romantic encounters are charged with eroticism and passion. This book is a little different from the rest in that it doesn't have as conclusive an ending. The ending is the obvious jumping-off point of the next book in the series, ""Camp Hell"". Being enjoyable in of itself, ""Secrets"" also serves to build great momentum for the conclusion found in ""Camp Hell"", making the two novels combined an incredibly enjoyable and passionate experience.

3813,B001AWYAZ8,"[7, 8]",3,"This review is split into two sections. The first section has to do with the subject matter and how it is presented. The second has to do with how it was formatted for Kindle.Part 1I picked this up for my Kindle because I teach The True Story of Hansel and Gretel. The main characters in the book flee from the Bialystok ghetto, and it is difficult to find detailed infromation.Midler's story almost seems designed as if it was something he told and then typed, which is possible because he did present to a class in CA. This makes the style at times slightly disconcerting, especially towards the end of the book. Midler chronicles his life during the war, as the only member of his immediate family to survive as well as his experiences during the birth of Isreal, his travels to the United States, and his return to Europe. The book not only allows the reader a view into not only the war but into the current situtation in the Middle East. Not only that, but Midler ties the events into current events.Part 2However, the reason why I gave it three stars instead of the four it deserves is that the Kindle edition is very badly formatted. There repeatitive FFFFFFFF (multiple letters), huge chunks of paragraphs are repeated and chapter headings sometimes appear in the middle of sentences. This doesn't happen on every page, but it happens enough to be very, very annoying. The formatting lets down the importance of the story, for this is something that should be read and should be used in schools.","04 11, 2012",AF2LBP2GR7MUZ,Christine N. Ethier,1334102400

However, I am quickly finding they can be quite good and my opinion has changed.  I love the Cattle Valley series by Carol Lynne, so when I saw this novella from TA Chase (who I have read and enjoyed before) I went for it.The story is a fairly straightforward romance.  Tyler and JT are twins, and Tyler has always been the follower, taking care of JT on the rodeo circuit.  Until he finally decides he needs a life of his own, possibly with the handsome horse breeder Ren, that he can't get out of his heart.  There is angst in the story (JT having slept with said horse breeder simply b/c Tyler wanted him!) but it is nothing heartrending and easily overcome by the couple - as it should be in a novella that doesn't have the time or scope to expand.  The sex (I know you romance junkies are wondering) was excellent, better than I find in most short stories/novellas.  Chase throws a bit of kink into the mix, so it's not vanilla, but it is also far from BDSM.  A little bondage and some spanking heat the sex up very satisfyingly without tipping into uncomfortable.  I could easily reread this story again.A couple things did annoy me, such as Tyler constantly referring to Ren as ""the older man"" and the somewhat abrupt ending.  There was the requisite HEA, but a couple more paragraphs would have ended it more smoothly. Overall though, it was a very good story and I actually hope there'll be a sequel with JT.","07 29, 2009",ACEA95FQS1AVP,Jem,1248825600

She was working eighty hours a week with absolutely no friends or dates to take the pressure off.Belle Taylor had always had a crush on Rafe Bettencourt since she was a little girl.  They had been neighbors since before she had been born.  Even now grown up as an attorney, she felt the same tug at her heart when she was near him.  When she arrived home, her family was horrified at Belle's appearance.  She had lost a lot of weight, looked overly tired, and had the darkest circles under her eyes.  Rafe long considered family couldn't believe his eyes either.  He had stopped thinking of her as simply family since she had graduated from law school, and decided this was the time to make sure she knew she was his.  Rafe knew they had many issues to work out like the fact that they lived in two different towns, but he knew the time was right for them.Good Christmas story.

Perhaps in the last third of the story I would have found something redeeming in it, but I'll never know...I gave up on it shortly after Mark makes it home from his protracted detention with the CIA.First, I give credit where credit is due.  The author is good with pen and paper.  His prose flowed and he's well practiced at clicking two words together to make a thought.  For that, I give him kudos.The story, however, is one mad depression from start to finish (or at least to as far as I got).  The cynical tone in the title says it all.  And the story elaborates.  We find that intelligent, and well-meant officials of the CIA can take the word of a man who is hell-bent on confusing that fine Intelligence Organization with a red herring, and turn the life of an innocent, nay not just innocent, but fine and upstanding member of the American Continuum into utter chaos, even though all they have is that one confession made under torture.  Perhaps there have been real honest mistakes made like poor Mark Taylor, but I found myself saying, ""no, this makes no sense.""  I could see them taking in an innocent Middle eastern American and treating him this way (because they are at heart racist bigots), but not someone who looks like an altar boy from Northern Scotland, ready to take vows.  As far as I was concerned, the premise was flawed from the beginning.  I kept expecting the ""thriller"" portion to cut in when Mark Taylor breaks out, finds the culprit who framed him and then sets the world right, but that never happens.  Even after he is released, life goes downhill rapidly for him.  I suppose there is some redeeming moment in the book when he shakes of the shackles of oppression and decides that he is going to fight for justice and the rights of his fellow humanity, but I never saw it coming and I never will. I gave up reading it.You've heard of jingoistic diatribes?  Well this is the same kind of claptrap, only coming at the reader from the opposite end of the spectrum.  If you simply enjoy a good book for the escape it provides, then don't pick this one up because, admittedly, this is a well-drawn picture of hell on earth.  If you enjoy torture, a never-ending spiral downward where everyone turns against you (after all if the CIA thinks you're evil, you must be) and a depressing tale that includes a heaping helping of abuse upon the best efforts of our government to fight terrorism, then go ahead and pick it up.  If that's the kind if read you enjoy then you probably watch Apocalypse Now once a week as vindication of the filthiness of the human condition, especially as it is manifest in the American soul.  For me, life as I now live it in the real is hard enough.  I found nothing redeeming in this book and plan on giving the author a wide pass in the future.","06 12, 2011",A2HIVYSH5QAV7Z,"John A. M.

The inhabitants of the Galaxy (who are way beyond the humans technologically) are so damned scared of the humans, primarily because of a statement that Alexander The Great made in the past, that they literally tremble of fear just by mentioning the name Alexander. That is just so much bullocks.If you can get past the silly background story the book makes for a quite enjoyable reading. Unbelievable but enjoyable. To some small extent it reminds me of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter books. Lone hero stranded on alien planet. Of course the hero can alternate between dinner chatting, amazing speeches before the &#8220;senate&#8221; and killing dinosaurs with swords. Oh, did I mention that he is a strategically expert as well, both political and in space warfare. Not bad for a former ex-football player. As I wrote already, the story is somewhat unbelievable.Some of the book is spent with dialogues between the aliens which can become a bit tedious at times. They are still well written though. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of political intrigue and treachery going on among the aliens. Something which is definitely not my favourite topic. I found myself, perhaps not really skipping, but reading a wee bit faster on most of this so that I could get back to the chapters that were about Alexander himself instead.The book also uses the old, let&#8217;s convert our wet navy ships to space ships that have been used quite a few times in various books. I do not know why it is so popular. It is not exactly a scientifically sound concept. It would probably take at least as much time to make an old battleship airtight, not to mention all the other stuff that needs to be done, as making a new hull from scratch. Then we have other facts such as a wet navy ship would not have firing arcs on 50% of the directions in space. It is just a silly idea.The ending is fun although it is also a bit on the unbelievable side in how incredibly rapidly it plays out and the stupidity of the aliens. It does really set the stage for the next couple of books though. Some people complain about the poor editing and loads of grammar and spelling errors making the book unreadable. I have to say that I found nothing that had any great impact on the readability of the book. In general I found the book enjoyable. Maybe I got a revised version. If it had not been for the weird background story and the fact that most of the book took place down on planets it would have gotten a higher rating.","04 28, 2013",A1RLYCQVO9OJ0K,Dark Jedi,1367107200

Its written in a way that if you close your eyes and listen to her words you feel as though she is speaking just to you, regarding her life when times were very very hard. Not driving she had a very limited means of getting around places until she was older and then she learned to drive.  Her husband was not encouraging in her getting out and about on her own, and in some way, not real supportive, but that was the way men were in those days.  I loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone wanting an very interesting peek into America's history.","01 19, 2013",AGSGL6VT17RE0,"Dora M. Gourley ""Dora G""",1358553600

The first few pages were great and they were leading to something but it got to the middle and i got lost. There should have been some story when the characters are engaged. It jumped from sex to we're madly in love to marriage in a chapter. And the deportation part-- really?Truly a let down.","06 21, 2014",ABX8KP720435P,Reader,1403308800

Yes, There are 2 'love' scenes in it, but one the author described as rushed kind of affair... and the other happens in the end.Truly this is an adventury kind of book. My husband asked me what I was reading and I told him a book that reminded me of that Kevin Costner movie ""The Postman"" (1*997).You have breakdown of a society..our world. So picture the whole 'postman' setting- people living without electricty and the like. There is one community/colony where Dan and other cool people (I really like the characters she puts in place) live together to stay safe. Of course- in this world we have to have some drama- so there is a band of bad guys- so we have those too.Now Dan comes across Selena in a scouting kinda thing. And I won't give anything away. But the story is all about her either joining the community or not, and keeping her safe.","01 7, 2013",A1G2GYX8B4OH8W,loulouc,1357516800

Elements of it were good and nothing was particularly bad, but it didn't spark an interest, either.StrengthsRepaying the debt. Very amusing and funny, I like where Dare took this.Characters. Although the main characters were fine, I was more interested in some of the side characters, specifically three of the lions who, since they have their own books, I am tempted to read more about. As for the main characters, they were both acceptably human and realistic, and although I connected to them, I wasn't really too emotionally involved.WeaknessesI found the conflicts hard to buy and didn't feel incredibly invested in the characters or their plight. Although I wanted them to get together, I didn't feel a sense of struggle in them doing so, although I did want them together and was frustrated (like they were) with their situation.The shifter's place in society seemed a little odd, because people seemed to know about shifters (enough that some would be willing to be 'thrown to the lions') but outside of the den scenes, we don't get any mention of shifters. I wanted to know more about the society, especially since culture played an important role with these two characters.","07 24, 2011",AAW8KJYQJMPQT,Alex W,1311465600

And a spunky heroine who doesn't let her deafness slow her down! And a guy who has all the power of an Alpha and isn't afraid to challenge for the right to lead his pack! *flaily hands*I really do like Robyn and that she's not afraid to be feisty and show the boys that she won't be pushed around. She handles everything that's thrown at her with grace (and sometimes a bit of temper). Considering that the big things she has to deal with is finding out she's a wolf and that one of the hot guys she's sharing the cabin with is her mate... well, she has a lot to take in.Keil and TJ were pretty hilariously awesome together. TJ is a crack up. Just... ha! I can't wait until his story. Keil is big and bad and he has the power to lead their pack. Finding Robyn is the icing on the cake. Oh, plus there's that hot sex thing.

But the separation was killing Quinn - he'd always been the strong, silent type, figuring that's what he should be.  A talk with his brother Ben made him think back - and he made a decision.  Changes that had come over the years they'd been together were possibly what the problem was?  Well, when he finally got together with Libby and let her see how he really felt - and she did the same - their life together changed quite a bit.
