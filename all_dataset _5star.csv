Believe it or not I've actually read worse. But the author does a large amount of telling instead of showing. For example, Ty will often tell us how Gwen was feeling rather than the author showing us through Gwen's actions and expressions. Typical beginning writer mistakes. The characters as well were unfortunately cardboard cut outs, and some of their actions poorly motivated, IOW unbelievable. No chemistry between the characters either. Unfortunately I won't be looking for anymore of this author's works. Had I paid for this, I'd feel cheated.","01 7, 2011",AJMKMTV1D2TFM,Joanne Stewart,1294358400

7272,B004JN0GAI,"[42, 47]",5,"I purchased this story because of the setting.  I usually love Scottish romances and am a fan of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  I figured this would be a short, enjoyable story...and in all truth, it should have been.  It has the makings of a wonderful story, but it seems as if the author got greedy and decided to publish a skeletal outline for a quick sale.  There are too many holes, and it's simply too short to be worth paying for.  For instance, once he realizes ""Reva"" is a girl, he decides to hold her hostage instead of having her executed.  He tells her she has earned her next meal and better lodging, and then in the next sentence, suddenly it's 2 months later and they can't stop thinking of each other.  What?!  She's coming to breakfast, he's staring at her, and they've both fallen in love with each other during those 2 months, even though from what I can tell, they never actually talk to each other?  He still doesn't know who she is, and all she knows of him comes from people who live under his protection.  This is a huge fault, Jackie Barbosa.  You cannot expect the reader to believe they are in love simply because you say they are.  We need to see some sort of progression.  And then to believe that she, a strong woman who would rather face execution and surrender her family name, would blurt out that she's fallen in love with him when  he's her familial enemy?  Ridiculous!  I'm insulted as a reader that I'm expected to just go along with this absurd plot with no attempt to show me how it happened.  With more length and attention to the missing pieces, this could have been a good story.  What a waste!","09 10, 2011",A3NCV7XVGNHRT6,"teacher mom ""teacher mom""",1315612800

11183,B0031LJ57O,"[1, 1]",5,"Just to explain, I know that some might think a 3.5 star rating would equal a C+, but to me, a 5-star book is one that is truly exceptional.  I think this deserves more than a C+.  See below.This is a sci-fi book about Lucy who suddenly finds herself beamed up into outer space.  From there, she quickly embarks on a relationship with Three, who is actually a human who lost his memories and is trying to return home.  I didn't mind the amount of sex in this book because Elsborg writes erotica very well and this book was nice and hot.  Lucy's thoughts were also hilarious and it was great to see the change and impact she had on the alien culture.  Also, in my opinion, the author did write just the right amount of a plot with sufficient details.  I categorize this author as an erotic author.  That being said, there needs to be plot and sex.  Personally, I feel a little cheated out of my money when I get a book that looks like erotica, but is just one or two sex scenes filled with plot that is not very good.  Here, I think you actually have a good balance of the two.So why only 3.5 stars?  Because I never went back and re-read this.  There are other Barbara Elsborg books that I have read and re-read and re-read.  Mostly her shorts, such as Snow Play and Power of Love.  I think she really does do short stories very well, and also, her novels tend to be on the longer side.WARNING/SPOILER: this is a story about Lucy and Three's relationship.  However, there is also MM sex in this book, although it doesn't involve Three.","09 25, 2012",A77DYZSK06F2M,Picky User,1348531200

Unlike most ""survival / stranded / desert island"" stories because of how this is set up civilisation for this mountain community is not destroyed so they have the resources that are there and do not have to build from scratch exactly.

The story is simply written and the problems encountered are too easily overcome but all of the characters and locations are well described so that I can visualise them.

2747,B000R93DPS,"[1, 1]",5,"Brody, formerly a special ops officer in the Marine Corp, is a 30-something Renaissance Literature professor with a thing for one of the students who just completed this semester's class.  Missy is 26 and working her way through college with dreams of going to medical school.  One night, when her crush, Professor Brody, comes into the adult store where Missy works, a little chit chat leads Brody to volunteer to teach Missy to play poker.  When a few friendly lessons in cards turn into lessons in the bedroom, Missy's inhibitions about her weight threaten to crush their relationship.  Can Brody convince Missy to up the ante and turn this two of a kind into a full house or will Missy fold instead?Do you remember those first few romance novels you read?  If you were at all like me, you snatched them from your mother (or aunt) and alternately grinned and giggled through them.  Part of it was because of the intimacy of the subject matter (even if the books were sedate compared to what you read today) and part of it was reading something maybe you shouldn't have been.  That's exactly what this book was like for me - I found myself grinning and giggling like a happy fool throughout the story.For me, this book had it all... a slightly dangerous, slightly possessive, handsy hero, a mouthy but shy-about-her-weight heroine, a whole lot of sexy banter, sweet but hot monkey love, and a couple of girlfriends (from previous books) that are supportive and maybe a little crazy.  I loved that Brody and Missy have a good time together, whether they're fooling around, fighting, or just having a simple conversation.  Brody is a little unreasonable sometimes, but Missy doesn't just let him run her over - she pushes back.  The back and forth repartee between Brody and his brother is funny and demonstrates their good relationship.Missy is somewhere around a size 16/18 (according to Brody's estimation, though a definitive size is never given for her).  As a result of the encouragement and self-confidence that Brody and her friends help to build up, Missy undergoes a bit of a physical transformation.  I can't explain, as a plus-sized woman, how thrilled I was to watch her change without having to lose weight and to see how well-received it was by her circle of friends.  So many stories about curvy heroines require that she loses weight to finally get the attention/love of the hero.  I was so pleased that Brody helped her to reveal this hidden part of herself while her curves remained unchanged.Since this book is listed as erotica, the story is explicit, but it's the parts outside of the proverbial bedroom that made this book so great to me.  When writing a story, an author can develop characters by telling you what they are like or by showing you.  For example, suppose you have a character that readers should believe is dangerous.  With ""telling"", the author has narrative in the story that basically says the Hero is dangerous - he used to be a Marine, he knows how to fight, etc.  With showing, there's a fight and the Hero takes on five armed men while he only has a broken pool stick.  With ""showing"", you get to experience and see for yourself that the character is who the author wants you to think they are.  It's much easier to tell readers about the hero/heroine, especially in erotica where so many authors think the storyline is just about the sex.  With this story, however, there's a magical balance of telling and showing.  We know Brody wants Missy, but then we get to see it.  He constantly touches her when they're together, he can scan a crowd to find her, he likes to hold her hand, he encourages her to be sexually open with him because he loves her body as is, etc.I've read several of Lena Matthews' books in the past and they're always well written with creative but still sweet love scenes.  This story was probably my favorite of her books and a fantastic value for the current (Kindle) price.  The story is probably a 3 to 4 hour read.  Highly recommended.","11 13, 2011",A88USYRFGDUTK,K.

Discovering she's female, Asher refuses to fight her, because, even when beseiged by pirates, a gentleman never harms a lady.  Emerald repays him by knocking him overboard and out of harm's way, not knowing this will make Asher the pirates' captive. It eventually loses him the use of his right hand and his brother his sight. Asher escapes and returns to wipe out the stronghold and kill her father and this is where the story begins. Emerald follows him to England. It isn't for revenge but to retrieve her father's walking stick he took because inside it is the map to a treasure she can use to pay off Beau Sandford's debts and free herself from the past.Using her father's family name and right to a title, Emerald becomes Lady Emma Seaton. Naturally Asher's suspicious of her and intrigued because of her obvious lies and uneasiness in high society. Of course they fall in love but this is more an in-depth study of the main characters attitudes than a mere will-they/won't-they love story. Asher is bound by duty and honor...and extreme guilt. His wife died while he was seeking his revenge, his brother was blinded during his rescue. He returns to his family home a widower, disabled in body, but more disabled in spirit, blaming himself for the tragedies occurring during his own travail. Emerald meanwhile sees herself as the cause. If she hadn't knocked him overboard, none of this would've happened.  Still pursuing her hunt for the walking stick, she believes the only way she can repay Asher for the misery she  has caused is to become his mistress and give him back  the love he lost and remove his grief over his brother's condition.It's an interesting story and an entertaining one, sensuous in spots, but staying away from the ballrooms and usual locales for such tales with most of the action taking place at Asher's estate. Flashbacks give reasons for everything that happens instead of playing them out in detail. Though this is the only James' novel I've read, I got the feeling there may be more on this family because of various hints given. If so, I'd like to read them,too.Harlequin Historical #888This novel was a gift to the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.","06 8, 2014",A3S7REHVBOSTLR,Toni V.

Cait is a character I would love to be friends with and who wouldn't want to spend a night in the arms of Cord and Dolan?  What impressed me most about Take Me (besides the sexy cowboys) is the natural emotional complications which arose after the trio's passionate encounter.  I dreamily sighed over Cord's possessiveness and I admired how Ms. McKade handled Dolan's attraction to Cait.  In the hands of another author, Dolan's desire to start a relationship with Cait might have annoyed me or detracted from the tale.  However, this is not the case; Ms. McKade deftly handles the emotions of all involved and I was more than happy with the story's ending.

The problem is the only time he speaks in the book he comes across as a manipulative, controlling jerk. The scenes where she supposedly sees the fun sweet side of him she falls in love with are only briefly described in a general way. Diona, the heroine is also described as beautiful, intelligent and strong however again most of her scenes display her as weak willed and pathetically willing to take the crap the hero is dishing out. Because of this I had a very hard time believing this whirlwind love that was supposed to have taken place between them. Lots of sex yes, love...I never really saw it. Even the one scene that had the potential for it, when she saves the girl, is ruined by him acting like a horny teenage boy.However I could have given the book a little more credit if it hadn't been for the horrible grammar and writing style. Constantly changing tenses mid sentence, writing it mostly from a perspective as if the story is recalling a past event but telling it as if its happening in real time. Also I don't know how many times the writer used the word ""had"" but I found myself mentally blocking it out as I read to tolerate the story.

2549,B002GYVWAK,"[9, 9]",5,"Of all the Jules Verne ebook compilations containing 30+ titles currently available in the Kindle store, this Halcyon Press edition is pretty good. An active TOC pinpoints specific content. I am particularly happy to see a full and modern translation of ""20,000 Leagues"" by F.P.Walter (though he is not credited and his informative, introductory essay is not included). I'm also glad to see a true (""Professor Lidenbrock"") translation of ""Journey to the Interior of the Earth"" rather than the sadly all-too-common bogus (""Professor Hardwigg"") version often passed off as being by Verne. The other major works are translated reasonably well keeping in mind that these are older, public domain versions. I do, however, prefer a slightly different public domain version of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Dick Sand,"" but that's a mere quibble.I have two more quibbles. FIRST is that several times a graphic will not be included but the words ""graphic appears here"" will appear instead. SECOND is that italics are often represented by an underline before and after the emphasized word(s), __like this___, a confusing annoyance when the names of several ships (normally italicized) are being referred to. These are not deal-breakers but something you may wish to consider (and because of them I have subtracted one star). The formatting is otherwise okay.As to containing 36 works, the count is inflated a tad by counting the two parts of ""Captain Hatteras"" as separate entities and unnecessarily including (and counting) a duplicate portion of ""Mysterious Island.""  You really get 34 distinct tales (not 36)--but that is still a lot of Verne, though it is by no means complete. That honor goes to Delphi.Delphi has a truly complete set, though a dozen works (not yet cheaply available in public domain translations) appear in French for the sake of completeness. Since I am not fluent in that language, I do not fully appreciate their inclusion. I do, however, greatly appreciate the inclusion of about 20 (!) more titles--in English--than this Halcyon (or any other) set. This makes the Delphi edition the largest and most appealing to me (even though the aforementioned modern translation by F.P. Walter is not used in it).I would encourage you to search, sample, and compare because new Verne collections keep popping up all the time in the Kindle Store. Check to see which titles are included, if the main TOC is active and takes you to additional active TOCs (one for each book), and that the text is formatted to your liking. See if graphics and illustrations are included. The one you ultimately select will depend upon the level of your interest in, and the degree of your enthusiasm for, the writings of Jules Verne. If you want a substantial collection which includes the well-known great Verne classics, this Halcyon set (or a recent, $.99 one from e-artnow, which is worth examining) should be quite fine. But if you want even MORE (as in EVERYTHING), the very BEST is that all-inclusive Delphi set.","02 14, 2012",A295A2TPG8JJ7Y,Librarian,1329177600

Facing extinction as they struggle against escalating Antarean attacks, the proud warrior race begins the process of uniting with the Galactic Alliance to ensure their future.Captain Wulf Caradoc, as the heir of the Prime leader, is expected to assist with negotiations on behalf of his people.  The secret, secondary part of his agenda is to look for his gemate, the genetically ideal mate that will be bonded to him mentally, physically and emotionally until the end of his days.  The ambassadorial team he is assigned to escort is attacked by space pirates hired by Prime malcontents.  Despite their skillful defense tactics, Wulf, his crew, and their charges are in danger until Alliance forces can reach them.Captain Melina Dmitros is a top-notch Galactic Alliance officer who's paid her dues.  After receiving a distress message from the Prime ambassador party, she steps in to aid them.  When she finally meets the future Prime leader face-to-face, she is ambushed by the biological force of the Prime mating urge.  She is his gemate, his fated match and a Lost One.  Her body will not allow her to survive without him, regardless of how she feels.  Wulf is willing to do whatever it takes to claim and protect his mate so that they may persevere against their enemies.The action kicks up a dust storm in chapter one of Prime Obsession that never settles!  I was convinced that Captain Dmitros was a first-rate adrenaline junkie from all the non-stop battles.  I rarely encounter a novel with multiple action scenes per interval.  Melina takes on bad guys, dodges hits, sniffs out/repairs sabotages, and keeps time with her man.  It's all in a day's work for a woman that knows her way around the Prime as well as the Galactic Alliance.  Wulf is growls and nibbles when it comes to his mate, although he's more than earned his formidable Prime warrior and sex machine title.  However, Melina is always center stage and in the thick of it all.  I started to feel that she was beginning to upstage her man.  Ok, ok.  Admittedly, I do prefer strong, accomplished female antagonists.  Still, Melina proved a bit overwhelming at times.Wulf's growling seemed uh, well...ridiculous after a while.  I've read novels with alpha males expressing their protectiveness this way, yet the constant repetitiveness became excessive and silly after a while.  Of course, it was a relief to have Wulf take charge after watching Melina prove just how tough and skilled she is over and over again. I could better appreciate the developing relationship.  The author does an amazing job of revealing the awakening gifts from a gemat-gemate pairing. Once I got a grasp on the dynamic, it was okay for the plot to charge ahead.Prime Obsession is a fast-paced space opera outfitted in shiny new gadgets and modern characters.  If you're looking for a sci-fi novel brimming with loads of techno jargon, intergalactic intrigue and angst, you've come to the right place.  Melina and Wulf's chemistry decimates small planets.  The ""foreplay"" preceding their first time together behind closed doors covers way too much ground; it dangled on the storyline string a tad longer than I would have preferred.  The romance and dialogue occasionally feels dated, although I could appreciate some truly cute moments.  Monette Michaels' narrative style is clean and precise with crisp visuals that flow easily from scene to scene.  All in all, it's fun to be kept on the edge of your seat for the bulk of the ride.  That's no easy feat in a story with so many subplots and secondary characters.  If this is just the first installment, then the next episode will have to put in some major overtime to keep up.PatriceReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","01 22, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1264118400

10142,B003M5IP2A,"[1, 1]",5,"First of all, I have no problem with menage relationships because one of my all time favorite books is ""Their One and Only"" by Trista Ann Michaels which I loved. Surprisingly, my problem with this book was not the length. However, one of my problems was that I thought that four men having one woman was just overkill. Problem number two being that two of the guys swing both ways but they called themselves family. That was just disgusting!I have no problem with gays, but the fact that one man is being done up his rear by the other while she's performing oral sex on him was just too much for me. That whole visual killed it for me. These are also the same men she heard getting busy up the hall after the first night they all ""shared"" her, so there was no guessing where his junk had been the night before, but she still eagerly put her mouth on him as if it was no big deal...I GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT!If that was not enough, as I previously mentioned, I think four men was way too many for this book. Four people just made the sex scenes more chaotic and scattered to me. It was hard for me to keep up with who was doing what to who, and who was enjoying who, because there was so much going on. Another disappointment, or should I say inconsistency in the story, for me anyway, was after Rayna finally has sex with Jaime for they first time. The two lovebirds actually make a pact that from that point forward he is the only one that will ""get her mouth"" but I guess that only included kissing which I thought was absolutely ludicrous seeing as how later that same day after he has ""claimed her mouth"" the first thing she does is give David, the guy being done by his boyfriend, oral sex. Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that claiming her mouth would include that as well. So, it was perfectly okay to suck them off, just not kiss them, that makes a lot of sense. THINK ABOUT IT AND GET BACK TO ME...You add all that up, and the fact that the whole insta-romance between Jaime and Rayna was just not believable in any way to me just made me not like this book at all, and I really wanted to. I could have cared less about Jaime being scarred and maimed. I just didn't believe there was a real connection happening while she was being banged by three other men. There was literally no time for a real relationship to blossom between those two.I guess I'll just have to count on Ms. Michaels to come save the day again because it seems like she's the only author that gets these menage relationships right on paper.","06 19, 2014",A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,LadyLestat,1403136000

I didn't like the heroine, because I thought she was a shallow twit. The hero was okay but a bit of a drongo in that he couldn't seem to realise that he had to actually have some training to run a department store.The romance was not convincing in that the characters hated each other, then liked each other and then hated each other again - and nothing had happened between them except - in time honoured fashion - a misunderstanding which could have been cleared up in two minutes. Of course that doesn't happen in romance books!The managers were unrealistic and silly. Far too many typos in this one and at one time the wrong name was used for a character!The premise was good, but unfortunately the script didn't maintain the fun of the first few chapters.","02 26, 2013",A2HHKV9CQ03ZRA,Diana M.

Aubrey is still damaged from the betrayal of her now ex-husband, and since their divorce she doesn't have relationships with men. She dates and has sex. That's been working out well for her until her life takes a bit of a turn. Suddenly the homeless man across the street is spouting predictions that come true, her coffee shop goes up in flames, and Price Delacroix meets her, wants her, and refuses to be just one of her other men.There's no doubt that the heat between them is incendiary and the sex scenes smoking hot. The story is tightly compact, but due to the length, we get a much better idea of Aubrey as a character than we do Price, who never seems to develop much beyond superficial eye candy. I've read other novellas of this length that focused more on both character's definition, and realize that my preference lies in that area. I'm not criticizing this story, don't get me wrong. I think it was comprehensive, given length-constraints, in detailing Aubrey's character enough to lend her believability, and I enjoyed seeing her interact with her friend the hairdresser and the guardian angel. In fact, had Price's character been given just a bit more definition, I would have really liked this story. As it stands, I think it's better than okay, but just lacked a bit for me to make it truly enjoyable.

No matter what, I've enjoyed all of her stories, but the differentiator between I like her story and I love her story is definitely the length.  Both of her full length novels as part of this Karmic Consultants series are five stars.  This story is actually the first in the series and is not required to enjoy the others, but it provides a nice background and introduction to important characters.Lucy Cartwright is essentially a counselor for ghosts.  She helps them resolve their issues and to accept that they are dead so they can move on to the white light.  Unfortunately, you don't get to pick which ghosts come to you and since Lucy has been going through a dry spell romantically, she apparently is broadcasting her horniness to the dead.  This means that every horn dog ghost with unfulfilled sexual fantasies are visting Lucy with the hopes she'll be able to fulfill their cravings.  Of course it doesn't work that way and she can't even touch the ghosts, but she calls her boss Karma to see what she can do and Karma advises that she needs to get laid.The next day, Lucy is dragged out of bed by the pounding on her front door to find a strange, but hunky man on her doortstep and it's lust at first sight.  He introduces himself as Cox and tells her Karma sent him over so Lucy is mortified thinking Karma has sent her a gigolo to help her with her problem.  The thought of paying for sex is debilitating for only so long before she rationalizes she needs to get over her morals and succomb to temptation.  While she's entertaining fantasies in her head, the conversation gets a little awkward and it turns out that Cox is actually private investigator Jake Cox, Karma's brother, and he's there because Karma had a vision that a man who was recently murdered would be visiting her that evening.  Jake is investigating his murder and trying to track down evidence that will bring the murderer into custody.  Jake and Lucy have to wait it out together with the strain of their attraction since Lucy has to remain horny if she wants the ghost to show up.This story was fast paced with laugh out loud moments, but a whole lot less beleiveable, yes even with ghosts, than a full length novel where characters get a little more depth or there's more than your hookup within moments of meeting one another.  Although Lucy and Jake move on to be recurring characters in future books and actually a focal point for book 3, The Sexorcist, there really isn't much development of their relationship here beyond the physical.  Still, it's a light enjoyable escape and a great foundation for books 2 & 3.","05 17, 2011",A2KY76HK8DYRL3,A Book a Day,1305590400

3874,B002YNSBRK,"[2, 2]",5,"Is a powerful story about bullying and the consequences that occur to the victims. This book was written because something haunted the author's core about the Columbine School killing. The killers' young teenagers themselves were displayed as evil monsters and not given any forgiveness for their horrific actions of injuring and killing innocent victims. This reader is neutral and not looking to debate with anyone about the terrible incident. This reader brought up this sensitive topic because this story is a warning and should be read and discuss with all silent crying out victims and the bullies to bring the truth to the light. Not all are innocent when a psychopath is created.This book was written to see the world through the victim's eyes and how he was affected by the constant taunting and teasing and the lies he experienced every day. School became a torture chamber and he tried to let the adults in his life know that he hatred every moment being in an institution and be bullied by mindless insensitive jerks. I as a mother and substitute teacher know the signs when a child becomes phobia and fights like a demon to not go to school; it is a plea for help. That the children are being destroy by cruel intents be it physically or psychological abuse by his peers and will do everything in their power to protect themselves and become strangers under your own roof to not experience one more hatred name or label. These taunts paint a self -image and the child starts to believe she/he are stupid, retarded and other vile labels.This author plotted a dark fantasy with criminal intent to get the message across that bully is the worst damage anyone could experience, it lingers long after the bully moves on with their lives and not realizing the aftermath of their intents. It is very graphic and my stomach almost came up with some of the details. This story is out there but with some of the bullies today this message needs to be declared. Reading this book will definitely open up many eyes and minds to the destruction of an innocent child that was forced to turn into a Dr. Hyde and JekyllIn the author's words; ""His heart felt blacker than night, empty, soulless, cold. Unfixable,bleeding, damaged to the optimal degree. There was no going back to any former life, any former sanity. This was the end of it all, the end of him. His cries were so loud, he could not hear the television. Muffy was standing by his feet, licking his pant leg to try and ease his anguish.""""I'm the bull's-eye in the sights of millions. Put me in a room with a million people, I'm the only target. They can sense it. Are there others like me? All this time, people are afraid of Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy, Ed Gein but are they mentally disturbed? Is that why they kill people? Are they crazy? How can they be?

Like, I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book.Firstly, as a native Irish speaker, it kind of annoyed me to see Irish words thrown into this book. It just suggested a laziness to me. Using Irish words is fine if there's a reason for it, if your book features Irish legends, or characters, but this book has no ties to Ireland at all, so it was just a convenient way for the author to avoid having to create a language.Anyway, the reasons I didn't finish this;It's incredibly confusing. Most of the time I had no idea what was happening, but that was OK, because very little happened. I gave up a little over a quarter into the book, and the main character had been assigned to work as the doctor on a pleasure ship, had a few run-ins with the staff, and that's it.The main character has no redeeming features at all. She comes across as arrogant, holier-than-thou and self-important. She didn't entice me to keep reading at all.The main male character similarly, is flat and uninteresting. He used to be one of the most elite fighters in the universe, now he serves as the captain of a 'floating brothel' because his mother, the queen, is punishing him for refusing to marry. He is arrogant, rude, and while I'm sure he's stunningly attractive, there is no physical description of him, the ship, the universe. There is no world-building.This book is meant to be erotica, and to be fair, I gave up before there was a real sex scene, but I wasn't holding out much hope that they would be hot, given that two references to a man's penis were made, using the word 'dangly'.

10325,B002K2RSSS,"[1, 1]",5,"This Kindle version of Ernest Bramah's Max Carrados stories is a collection of stories originally published in pulp magazines rather than a digital version of a previously published book.  The collection covers the time period of 1914 (the first Max Carrados story, ""The Coin of Dionysius"") through the WWI years into the 1920s.  Very few Carrados mysteries are ""murder mysteries"" but are more likely to deal with fraud, theft and (in the war years) espionage.Although Carrados first appeared as the Sherlock Holmes stories were ending and seven years before the first Lord Peter Wimsey story was published, his stories have a distinct resemblance to both.  The blind detective has Holmesian powers of observation but a more affable personality and affluent lifestyle similar to Wimsey.Modern mystery readers may have some trouble adapting to Bramah's style particularly in the earliest stories.  Even with the Holmes stories, we are accustomed to a detailed exposition of the mystery and some kind of resolution for the characters (i.e., ""the boy and girl got married and had three children"", ""the murderer was tried and executed""). The early Carrados stories just stop.  Yes, the solution is revealed along with Carrados's observations but it can be a bit obscure particularly since modern readers won't be familiar with many aspects of daily life in the early 20th century. It took me awhile to understand ""The Ghost of Massingham Mansions"" since I am not familiar with the lighting or plumbing in use in 1890's apartment buildings.  But it was actually a very effective and touching way to end ""The Ingenious Mr. Spinola"".  Later stories are noticeably different as some do have more detailed endings.This would have been a pleasant enough read if not for a major failure in kindle formatting.  Although the first few and last stories are well formatted, the middle is difficult.  All sense of paragraphing and quotation marks are lost so that it is sometimes hard to tell who is speaking to whom and if it is a character speaking at all.  One later story suddenly appears at the end of another with no chapter break (and then appears again as its chapter in the table of contents).","02 8, 2014",A22UILFTP4Y4C2,"JZS ""JZS""",1391817600

Here are my problems with it:1. Jasmine (the heroine) she starts off seeming strong and independent. Then becomes immature at times and even submissive and sometimes flaky. Then she's back to acting strong again. She keeps flip-flopping from one way of thinking and acting to another.2. Keilan (her love interest) starts off seeming concerned about scaring her and not wanting to harm her in the beginning. He then turns into a dominating molester within the next chapter or so. He again becomes a sweet romantic love interest halfway in the book then dominating again. It's very confusing who these people are and what they are about. There were many other characters mentioned but you barely know them or understand where they are coming from either.3.The genre didn't seem to fit what was actually in the book. Yes there is some romance, there is fantasy/sci fi but there is also erotica in the book. I wish the author picked a genre and just went with it instead of tried to blend so many in one. She goes into descriptions of each in different scenes but the tone and feel of each scene doesn't always feel like the same book. Primarily the sexual aspects seemed really obscured compared to the rest of the book. I wish she would of just chose Full erotic novel OR Full romantic novel. Neither aspects seemed to blend together or stayed consistent in this book. Also the sexual aspects were so few and far between in the first half of the book that it seemed out of place.4. OK so the book is about a girl with Charmer abilities (can seduce shifter men with her scent basically) who happens to be best friends with a shifter princess. Why should we, as the reader, care about this and what does it have to do with the story itself? I'm not sure about that answer. Again if this was a full erotic novel some of the sexual themes and her seductive powers would make more sense. Like the sexy clothing and underwear in the beginning, is suddenly forgotten after the first &#34;molesting scene&#34; then she's able to wear dresses and regular shirts and pants. What was the point of that?? And a scene where an aphrodisiac was used then backfired to cause a loss of sex drive just didn't fit in. But since this is a romantic/action/fantasy I think?? I'm not sure why we should care or where the author was taking us with all this. Or why so many things were mention just to be resolved and forgotten about within a page or so later.So in a nutshell, there were things about it I liked. Things I didn't like and things that just didn't make sense to me. There were a lot of scenes and characters that could have been cut from this book to give it a more focused feel and shorten it. I hope the author chooses to rework this one and give it  more structure. She had a lot of cool ideas and interesting world she created but I feel her story needs more planing.

Perhaps if the author had given the romance portion time to develop slowly instead of the ""oops I couldn't control myself"", I might have been able to enjoy the story more.  Unfortunately, the author kept presenting the wife and lover as people of honour and the husband as a monster and while I believe she did the latter she failed miserably in the former. I also felt as if the ending was a cheat, I knew it was coming but I kept hoping that she would be a little more original.  I am not one of those people who expect the lovers to be virgins or even requiring the lovers to be limited to two of the opposite gender, however I do not like liars and sneaks and that is what this book is full of.","07 16, 2012",AU510CVD9XDG,"4Nbahu ""Free Book Hunter""",1342396800

This is the story of Gregory and Ryland who have known they are destined to be mates and have known since they first met years ago. Gregory has been waiting for Ryland to 'grow up' and now that he is over eighteen, Ryland can't understand why Gregory won't claim him.When they finally get together after some initial misunderstandings, it is hot and sizzling. The relationship starts with a bang and from that time forward the two men are all over each. Ryland is totally inexperienced and has been pining over Gregory and Gregory hasn't had sex for 6 years so they are very passionate!Once again not fully understanding the implications of the tri-omega causes problems and suddenly Ryland's life is at risk. Luckily the third mate for the relationship is discovered. Viktor immediately recognises Ryland as he mate but Gregory's prior claiming causes a few concerns but nothing Viktor and Gregory's attraction to each other can't resolve. And luckily Leyland, Lucas and Jake are able to share some more insight into the whole tri-omega workings. ""You know, it would have been really nice if someone had explained all of this to us in the very beginning. Maybe you should think about publishing a f***ing how-to manual,"" Gregory yelled before slamming the phone down.Once again, this is a fun book with great characters and lots of humour.

7367,B0035WTNSK,"[48, 52]",5,"Note: This review was originally published on Red Adept Reviews on March 8, 2011.Overall:  3 starsPlot/Storyline:  3 starsChristina was like a junior Wonder Woman - she skydived, scuba dived, and flew airplanes like an experienced pilot after only a few hours of instruction. If the girls were a little younger, and if the more violent scenes were rewritten or deleted, the story would be appropriate - perhaps even inspirational - for younger teenagers, but the story just wasn't believable enough for me.The first third of the book, which followed the three girls from age eleven through high school, wasn't that interesting and served little purpose. There were dead ends such as the chapter where Jessica's abusive stepfather Roy beat her mom senseless, broke down Jessica's bedroom door, and tried to rape her. Jessica had telephoned Christina to help her, so Christina rushed over and stopped Roy by threatening him with her shotgun. But there was no follow-up, no calling the police, no mention of the stepfather after that. And there was very little mention of any of the girls' parents, it's almost as if they raised themselves.About halfway through the story, the action picked up and the story got more interesting when the three girls entered college. Christina started flying lessons, Heather became romantically involved with an older man, and Jessica studied old Spanish archives to locate sunken treasure. The three girls were now living their dreams. During a summer break, they embarked on a trip to the Bahamas on a treasure-hunting expedition that ended in tragedy. And this is where it really got too unbelievable for me. Christina showed flying skills that only a veteran pilot would have, even though she had not even earned her pilot's license. Her instructor had told her that she was the best student he had ever taught, but it was too much of a reach to believe she could fly planes as expertly as she did in the story.The story had too many convenient coincidences (such as an uncharted island being right where you need it) and implausible events (such as Jessica pinpointing sunken Spanish treasure that had eluded professional treasure hunters for years).I do have to say that the scene where Christina sought revenge on the culprit responsible for the Bahamas disaster was quite satisfying, even if it was a bit improbable.Characters:  4 starsChristina, Heather, and Jessica were the main characters, and the author did a good job of developing them as flesh and blood people, even if their emotions didn't always seem realistic to me.Writing style:  3 starsThe author's writing style was generally good, but the emotions and the dialogues of the story's characters were not very realistic at times. After witnessing the sudden, violent death of a close friend or relative, most people would be devastated and in shock. These characters, however, got over tragedies quickly and moved on.If you're going to have your characters engage in specialized activities, an author should be familiar with those activities. There were some glaring errors in this regard. For example, while skydiving for the first time, Christina ""pulled the ripcord and tossed it to the side."" I've skydived, and you don't toss the ripcord away, for two reasons: (1) it could kill someone on the ground, and (2) ripcords are not cheap to replace. She also pulled the ripcord at 1,000 feet, which is well below the minimum altitude for opening your parachute. Trust me, you get yelled at for things like that and get banned from a drop zone.Later, when Christina was taking flying lessons, she goes up with her instructor in a ""Citborea,"" an aerobatic aircraft. I think the author meant a Citabria.Editing:  2 starsThe book was in serious need of editing and proofreading. I found quite a few grammatical and punctuation errors, and misspellings were found every few pages. A few examples: ""ought"" for ""aught,"" ""ware"" for ""were,"" ""ya'll"" for ""y'all,"" ""brake"" for ""break,"" ""waist"" for ""waste,"" ""metamorphous"" for ""metamorphosis,"" ""depravation"" for ""deprivation,"" ""choral reef"" for ""coral reef,"" and so on.","07 29, 2011",A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,J.

This book was chocked full of sex, heat, more sex, domineering alpha-male werewolves, and a weak whiny human woman. Oh and more sex. The dialogue was 'off'. That's the best word to describe it because the conversation between the whiny chick and her werewolf was disconnected at times. He would say something, and she would respond to something else. And another thing that irritated me. SHe was always ""fighting back tears"". Ugh, really. So weak and pathetic. I can not stand weak women characters.

7472,B000ZKNRPK,"[0, 0]",5,"Emma Wildes short novella about an innocent aristocrat and a rake works very well in places and other times its a tad flat.The opening scenes of this novel are well written because it gives the reader a good background of the characters and they have a history which makes this novel believable.  Cassandra has always had a big crush on her brother's best friend nobleman Ross Benson.  Cassandra is young only nineteen and she is a bluestocking enjoying country pursuits much more than London gaiety.Ross and his friend are drunk and when Cassandra helps him to his room he engages in some romantic kisses that end up with the two in bed.  Ross does the honorable deed of course and offers for her and Cassandra agrees to the wedding.  She is astute enough to realize she could be pregnant.What follows mostly in this short story is their adjustment to married life.  Ross simply loves London and his wife does not.  Ross genuinely likes Cassandra but his feelings are not fully engaged until later.  I liked Ross because he did not take himself too seriously and he had a teasing but kind sense of humor.I cannot say the same about Cassandra who was tart, somewhat priggish (surprising for a woman whose first intimacies are outside marriage) and she just did not respond well to Ross's sweet teasing and innuendo.  He was a dynamic interesting person while Cassandra comes off as humorless and interested more in her books than her surroundings.  She never was as charismatic as her lead which leaves this book with a three star rating.","09 26, 2011",A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,Melissa,1316995200

They use the mysterious woman known as the Traveller to find her. His mate happens to be Allyson Gray, a police officer investigating the disappearance of Alysia James. Jorel travels to her dimension to bring her home.PROS: It had it's good moments.CONS: Allyson was so annoying. It's one thing to be strong and tough, but Allyson took it to the point that I wanted to hit her. Frankly, I don't even know why Jorel was needed for this story. The author basically neutered him. Ally does all the fighting and saving. I don't object to a strong female lead. I don't object to a woman saving herself. What I object to mostly was that he couldn't even have a simple conversation with this prickly, irritable woman.More realism was needed. I accept another dimension with shapeshifting people, but human nature should still be the same. Allyson comes to this new dimension with very few questions. I think it would be natural to be full of questions and wonder at this new world.The little detail about Alysia James gets abandoned or forgotten. Ally never finds her. I mention this because I don't feel like I'm spoiling a key plot point here. Ally never mentions Alysia again after she's kidnapped by Jorel.2 STARS: I had to force myself to finish this one.

6185,B002V1H2ES,"[5, 5]",5,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 8/10PROS:- This story is a nice progression from the one before it (Bound by Deception). The characters' personalities are consistent between stories but have evolved as a result of their relationship, and Oliver and Vincent struggle with the sorts of problems I would expect to have arisen in the past 6 months since they first got together.- Oliver's situation is quite sad. He's in love with a man (a hanging offense), he's almost destitute (for a gentleman, anyway), he's the son of a man with a terrible reputation for excessive gambling, and Vincent treats him with very little emotional affection the majority of the time. Yet he doesn't allow himself to wallow in self-pity, and I like that about him.- The sex scenes are hot, with a touch of BDSM. It's interesting reading about sex toys from 1830s England. I don't have any idea whether they're realistic or not, but I'm sure the author did some research before including them.- I liked the ending quite a bit. It mentions the *possibility* of unhappiness in the future, but given the time frame of the story, it's as happy as it can realistically be.CONS:- Much of the story is sad in a hopeless, ""I'll never have what I want from life"" sort of way. (Once again, though, happy ending...)- I got super annoyed with Vincent's treatment of Oliver and with the fact that Oliver puts up with it for so long. Vincent treats Oliver basically like a prostitute for the majority of the story: he uses Oliver for sex and then leaves so he can get back to his uber-important, aristocratic life. He insults Oliver over and over again, and Oliver is so whipped that he simply takes it. I did get an idea of WHY Vincent is such a jerk sometimes, but his selfishness took a lot of the romance out of the story for me.Overall comments: I liked this story overall: it's well written and contains a few decently graphic sex scenes--which, with the inclusion of bondage and light pain games, are unusual for a Regency story. The story is about 75% angst, though: it has a good ending, I think, but the majority of the journey to get TO that ending is a little rough.","08 22, 2010",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T.

There's a sense of pleasure in the knowledge that she hasn't let Peter's betrayal destroy her.Antonio and Santos have thoroughly enjoyed the time they've spent with Jane.  They've shared women before but Jane's the first one who's really brought out the possessive and protective instincts in both of them.  The men are stunned to learn about Jane's previous relationship with Peter and how long she'd been deceived.After learning about Jane's ex's disrespectful proposition and abusive behavior Antonio and Santos vow that they will pay Peter back for hurting their woman.  Jane simply wants to get on with her life now and forget that the relationship with Peter ever happened.  Besides why worry about the ex-jerk when she has the evening's activities to look forward to - and Antonio and Santos definitely know exactly how to get her juices flowing.While Jane's dealing with her men and preparing for the masquerade ball, her best friend Lily has a bit of drama of her own unfolding.  She and Jean Jacques have reached a stalemate in their relationship and he's openly flirting with a bevy of blonde bimbos.  She's insanely jealous but letting it show would be intolerable.  Fortunately Lily has a special friend who is more than willing to help her elicit a reaction from Jean Jacques - and even if he doesn't react well, Jane will have at least scratched an itch.REINVENTING JANE PORTER is the third book in Dominique Adair's JANE PORTER SERIES. I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each of the characters in this series and loved the sexual freedom that is such a prevalent theme throughout each individual story.  Jane's relationship withAntonio and Santos could easily be just three individuals indulging in their sexual desires but it's apparent that their feelings go much deeper than they'd expected.  Lily and Jean Jacques's heated encounters really got my heart pounding and definitely kept me in anticipation of each new scene.  In REINVENTING JANE PORTER we're treated to more of the characters we love as well as a couple new ones you'll love to hate and an additional suspense element that clearly displays the depths of the feelings between the characters.If you haven't read the first two stories in the JANE PORTER series I highly suggest doing so before reading this book.

Gregor is the second eldest of the Faustin brothers; from the Russian vampyr family line. He runs a series of successful clubs, made famous for the fact that they cater to New York's vampire population - a publicity cachet the clubbers love, and the vampyrs appreciate. Gregor has his pick of women, and is at the top of his game, so the last thing he needs is for fate to interrupt his life. But when you're a Faustin vampyr, you have to listen when destiny speaks . . . or suffer the consequences.Gregor is told the name of his intended bride - Madelena. But Gregor ignores the heads-up and continues on his partying ways . . . unsuspecting, until fate intervenes with a crash.`Bound by Blood' is the second book in Evie Byrne's `Faustin Brothers' trilogy. Though it is the second book, the plot timing seems a little out-of-sync with first book `Called by Blood'. In this book, Alex is a rampant bachelor and is yet to meet his wife, Helena. So really, it would make more sense that `Bound' be the first book in this trilogy, instead of the second ...I am really liking Evie Byrne's `Faustin' trilogy. I love the fact that Byrne is writing a modern vampire tale - her characters are clued-up about vampiric myths and fanged pop-culture icons, but there's also an old-world vibe. Each brother finds his bride through premonition - fated by their mother who has dreams of her future daughters-in-law. In `Called' Alex was ecstatic to finally find his bride, partly because his older brother had recently settled so well into holy matrimony. But as we back-track, it's revealed that Gregor in fact found fate to be rather inconvenient. I love that Byrne marries some old-world mysticism with modern inconvenience - a New York vampire club owner who is put-out by his destined bride. Hilarity ensues when fate intervenes, brutally.In `Called by Blood', Byrne took a very different romantic route - by severely burning her Alpha hero, and leaving him looking like raw hamburger meat. Byrne does it again in `Bound', this time posing a difficult dilemma before the heroine. I won't give it away, but I really liked the hurdle before Gregor and Madelena, if only because it completely turned the tables on the traditional vampire/mortal romance.I like Evie Byrne's paranormal romance. Once again, I wish the book had been longer, mostly because I think the really interesting part of the story would have come in the aftermath of the romance.

3546,B001HZY846,"[76, 83]",5,"REVISED 05-06-13: My initial inclination was to rate this set 4 or 5 stars until I realized it TOTALLY and consistently ignored Austen's use of italics in all her major works. Where Austen italicized a word for emphasis, this Bedford edition doesn't do so. Nor does it use all caps to equal italics, nor even before-and-after underlines (_like this_) the way some other editions do. When this was priced at only a dollar, some readers might have been willing to overlook this defect (if they were even aware of it), but now that the price has doubled to $1.99 (the same price as 2 superior editions in the Kindle Store), one shouldn't have to. I consider this a serious enough flaw to rate this Bedford edition only 2 stars (and as a fan of Jane Austen, I was sorely tempted to even rate it one lower).Some readers of this review may wonder why I consider this worthy of criticism. I do because Austen (whose wonderful works rate 5+ stars) was a true wordsmith; she meant precisely what she wrote and the manner in which she wrote it. The words she chose to emphasize contribute to the way she intended her stories to be read and understood. Since she is not excessive in her use of italics, when she does so it is significant to the precise nuance or witticism she is trying to put across. That's why it IS a big deal. Without italics, something of Austen is lost. Reputable print editions all have them; why not all ebook versions? Why not THIS one?Except for this defect the Bedford Park edition provides easy access to each title and to the chapters within each title. It provides the finished and unfinished novels plus a sampling of juvenilia. And the formatting is fine--except for the aforementioned lack of any indication of emphasis throughout (a defect which seriously mars an otherwise fine set).One can get virtually EVERYTHING Austen wrote for the same price ($1.99) from Delphi and from Palmera. (To see for yourself, type ""Delphi Austen"" or ""Palmera Austen"" in the Kindle Bookstore searchbox.) Delphi uses italics in 4 of the 6 major works; Palmera in 5 (so I lean toward Palmera). I did NOT recommend this Bedford edition when it was priced at only a dollar, and I do not recommend it now at twice that.","02 18, 2012",A295A2TPG8JJ7Y,Librarian,1329523200

4990,B0049H9268,"[13, 15]",5,"The premise of this book gave me high hopes for the adventures that would happen within its pages, but unfortunately I was disappointed. The book starts off with Mina doubting her relationship with her long time boyfriend Sam and feeling smothered by him simply because she sees a hot guy. Enter Blake, who is apparently so perfect and gorgeous he fails to get any type of personality beyond the cliche of the tortured bad boy who is actually a Nice Guy. Things change so quickly between Mina and Sam that their whole relationship is pretty much pointless. Sam is disposed of very conveniently early on, and I'm left to wonder if the book would have been a lot better without his character. Sam is really only the catalyst to keep Mina and Blake apart a bit longer and to distance Mina from her friends since they disapprove of Blake. The whole ""relationship"" between Mina and Blake is just so quick and based on nothing, that I couldn't even appreciate the few moments that were cute. ""Love"" based on destiny and the fact that a couple HAS to be together because it was written that way really offends me. What about free will and choice?Who is Mina? I'm not quite sure. Despite the fact that she is narrating the book, I feel like I have no clue who she is and what she is interested in, besides Blake. Sometimes I didn't really know what was happening at all, in fact. What exactly IS The Realm? I actually don't even have a clue. There's all this mysticism going on, with some immortal characters from the past and some that are mortal, but somehow related to people from Arthurian times. I just have absolutely no clue how it all works. It's fine to leave a bit of mystery, but when the reader doesn't understand anything about the world you've built (or failed to build), I think that's a problem.There is a lot of foreshadowing of doom and gloom at the beginning of the book which is annoying, especially because those levels of said doom and gloom didn't really seem to appear. Yes, bad stuff happened. But apocalyptic, everything is doomed levels of gloom? Not so much. Everything in the book seems a bit disjointed, in fact. There are random details about the background characters thrown in just for the heck of it, it seems, because they definitely didn't serve any purpose to the greater story. Add in some grammar mistakes and major formatting issues with the eBook version of the novel, and it leads me to believe there was very little proofreading.The last fifty pages of the book are infinitely better and more interesting than the rest of the book, and the ending feels like an entirely different book with how intriguing and well written it is. When I finished reading the book I admit that I was curious about what will happen next, but not enough to pick up the next book. The deficiencies that plague the majority of this story will definitely prevent me from reading on in this saga.","06 20, 2011",A3VB6DM761644D,Ashley @ Book Labyrinth,1308528000

Rae is a girl training to become a Cleric until one day she discovers she is a fairy. So, starts this book. The entire storyline takes place in 2 days but, oh boy! does a lot happen in 2 days. Rae is thrust into a war between 2 fairy factions, 2 love interests (the fairy named Breandan and the vampire named Tomas) and so on...I found the idea of the story interesting. This book does have some potential IF some very big issues are addressed.Grammar: If there was ever a book in need of an edit, this is the one. The grammatical errors, missing words, wrong words (at one point the author writes `right' when it should have been `wrong'), etc. made reading the book so distracting and frustrating that I could barely concentrate on the plot. I don't think I went 2 pages without encountering a mistake.Character development: Characters are largely undeveloped and have no depth, even the main ones. For example, we get very little in terms of interaction between Rae and her best friend Alex, so the events of the end did not have any effect on me whatsoever. We didn't get to care about Alex at all. We learned little about her, and only through Rae's narration. Basically, that is the problem, we learned everything from the author telling us than from the character development.Character interaction: I will make allowances for Rae's sudden trusting happy lovey dovey relationship with Breandan but, not with Tomas. We get no frame of reference, rhyme or reason as to why Rae is interacting with the vampire Tomas the way she is. From their first encounter to the second, there is a world of difference. I mean, talk about jumping the gun!Basically, this is a story with potential if the author decides to review it and expand on the book, fix the errors and get a good editor.

This is the case with this short story. The writers take an age old lesson and turn it into a good read. It begins with, as they call it, Crazy #1 who is picking up a hitchhiker and from there it gets graphic and a little much for my taste. Then it cuts to Nutcase #2 who is hitchhiking. They inevitably get together and the results are suspenseful. The ending I felt was well deserved on both accounts.I also watched the video of the two authors on how they decided to break this short story up and the idea was cool. One wrote their side for scenario 1 and the other did scenario 2 without talking with each other about how tier side was going. Then, when it came for them to bring the two pieces together, they made them fit perfectly.

Shayne and Jackson see something more in Sam, someone they want to protect, love and maybe even have a future with. With a little loving, respect and patience it might even be possible.Comments:- Contemporary Cowboy erotica with menage (threeway) sex.- 2273 kindle locations, 31739 words- Sex is m/f and m/f/m - very generous and loving, caring, gentle and all about her. No m/m. Aiming for a committed threesome.- While ""Dakota Ranch Crude"" is part of an anthology, it isn't a *series*. These books are in no way connected and can be happily read independently.Opinion:Although the suspense is a little wussy, the romance is very sweet and the sex terribly HOT. Shayne and Jackson are sexy Alpha-types, but not so overwhelming that they smother Sam. Sam has strength, character, and intelligence - when they order her around she listens, takes it on board and understands why they are making these demands. No one is demeaned or treated as a child. They all take an intelligent, thoughtful approach to their relationship and respect each other. It's Nice. And when they come together, it's Hot. An excellent book. Recommended.Aside:Although we have strongly Alpha men who like their woman to follow the rules they've put down for her ""safety"" and ""own good"", they are no where near as Dominant as the men of Brooke'sDesire, Oklahomaseries. If you are looking for that style of book, this anthology is not for you.

I almost always enjoy her stories to a varying degree, from good to very good except this story.  Oh...and except Velvet Cataclysm which I didn't like at all. Her writing style in this book is a bit like poetry in the way she uses her words.  Okay maybe not poetry but I don't know the word to describe it so here is an example. ""The amount of incendiary material he'd built up for Grace must have been monumental."" See what I mean?  The whole story is written like this, different.Now on to my thoughts about this story.First off Grace is NOT Trick's mother-in-law.  She was married to Trick's father Evan, so she is his stepmother!  Grace is described as his mother-in-law several times in the story, talk about confusing and not a good start to this book.  This story did get a bit better as it unfolded and the characters took shape for me.Trick was an asshat to Grace from the word go.  Grace was a strong, assertive woman with everyone but...Trick.  For the most part, Grace was Tricks whippy post, figuratively speaking that is--and she let him.  That's the part I disliked most, her hypnotic like acceptance of his treatment.  I understood it sure and it was explained at the end but I don't have to like it though.Then there was the mad dash to the end of the story where explanations' and secrets were revealed.  His reaction to these secrets was not what I expected meaning not much of a reaction.  No outrage or anger. The ending was just too rushed for me.

No where on this page does it classify this book under &#34;Christian&#34; anything.  Although I have not read this story to its completion yet I have read the sneak peak preview.  I am making this review now because of the 1 star reviews about the &#34;sex&#34; and it falling under a supposed Christian classification.  I certainly understand some readers being offended by overly graphic sex or even some sex in a book and not wanting that type of material.  What I don't understand is although it may have slipped under the &#34;Christian&#34; radar in recommended books why would a person purchase this title when NOWHERE in the DESCRIPTION or ANYWHERE ELSE on the PAGE does it reference &#34;God&#34; or &#34;Christianity&#34; once? I even clicked on the author to see if her other titles were &#34;Christian&#34;, there was only one other title and it was not of the &#34;Christian&#34; genre.  There are several genres that I do not like and will not purchase (Vampires, Dark Paranormals, Created Science Fiction) but due to crossing genre lines, Historical mostly, I occasionally get titles in my recommended list that are not what I want hence &#34;RECOMMENDED&#34;. I don't normally purchase a title under 300 pages because I have found that it takes at least that many pages to develop a decent story. This is actually one of those stories, not much over 100 pages.  That is the very first thing I look for is the length of the book. I normally would have just moved on to the next recommended title when I saw that it was a short story.  With this it just seemed strange that the ratings were so far apart.  In reading the reviews I found out why.  Seems unfair to the author to give a 1 star review because a reader didn't check the material before purchasing it.  If it was classified &#34;Christian&#34; I could understand those reviews but it is not!  I am giving it 3 stars at this time because I have not purchased the entire book, just the preview.

This was such a moving and thought provoking story to be aimed at a younger audience but I think older readers would enjoy it too. William Woodall really gets into the mind of a 14 year old boy. What I like about this author is that he's not trying to be like anyone else. He's not copycating C.S. Lewis like so many others try to do. He's not afraid to approach the Christian aspect but he doesn't beat anyone over the head with it either.  His work is unique and I really enjoy it.I think he should have included discussion questions at the end of this book because there are so many ways to start a conversation with the many themes it contains.I would give the writing 4 stars only because the characters weren't as distinct as in other books I have read by this author. For instance, the names Brandon and Brian were so similar I kept confusing them. I thought the two main characters could have used something in their speech to set each one apart. I really enjoyed the unique way he has of putting things though. Here's an example.""Nor did he dream, except the sweet and simple dreams of the pure at heart, of the kind that nourish the soul but are never remembered.""I should also mention that the writing reminded me of a bedtime story in places. Some people might find that a bit distracting but I felt it added to the fairy-tale fantasy feel. I give the story line 5 whole stars. I'm sure someone has written about similar things but this felt original to me.The Christian aspect I'd give 5 stars also. It is very appropriate for the intended YA audience but also appealing to a much wider age range. I could see reading this book in a homeschool setting. I guess because there are so many nuggets of truth hidden in there. It's about Heaven. It's about bad things happening for a reason. It's about deciding for yourself what matters most in life.

But Tad refuses to give into his wolf and a meaningless liaison, his human side and principals rule too strong. And so he fights every day to bury that part of him. Until the girl he once loved shows up and turns his world upside down.Missy Leason is running from her pack and almost out of time. A viscous alpha wants to claim Missy and use her for her Omega powers, willing to break both human and wolf laws if that means a rise in his own power. Missy hopes that Tad can save her but that means confessing secrets and convincing him that they're more than just first mates, they're true mates. But when Missy's Alpha finds them she may not get the chance because Tad must face him in a fight...without the ability to shift into a wolf like his adversary.Wolf Flight was another great story from Vivian Arend, this time starring Robyn's (Wolf Signs) brother, Tad. With suspense and action that will keep you turning the pages for more and naughty sex scenes with frustrating tension, Wolf Flight had a fuller feeling to it then the first book in the series despite it's shorter length.Tad and Missy's story almost run side-to-side of Robyn and Keil's time-wise, so you get to see Tad's feelings on his sister's mating as well as his own.

9428,B0010ZGPB2,"[4, 4]",5,"At first glance, I almost dismissed Longclaws as a seen-it-before monster novel, derivative of that 1980's horror that filled my bookshelves long ago.  I was very wrong.Instead, with Longclaws, I was immediately swept into some darkly fabulous storytelling.  Instead of struggling to finish the book, I was thinking about the book when doing other things, anxious to return to my reading.Now, to be honest, there were a couple of minor technical issues.  Block paragraphs instead of indentations.  Occasional odd formatting glitches like errant commas inside of words.  And some transitions that weren't noted with extra paragraph spacing.  But I score very hard on formatting and I have to say that the errors were very minor.  The author's storytelling was on point and sharp enough that the formatting only bothered me a little.What stood out for me most in this book is the attention to detail paid to the monsters.  Usually, in monster horror, the monster is pretty one-dimensional.  Monsters fall into very few categories.  Critter gets revenge by killing and eating.  Critter just kills and eats for not much reason at all.  Critter gets a hold of something radioactive and kills and eats.  You know the drill.However, in Longclaws, the author has not only built an entire history and social structure for his critters, he skillfully weaves it into stories of human history and mythology.  As you read, you find that you are delighted as your mind starts making certain connections into our shared history.Peek brings you into the minds of his monsters and, the funny thing is, you start to wonder who the real monsters are.  You start, little by little, to feel for them in their world of predator vs. prey.From reading a bit about the author, it seems like this might have been one of those books written long ago, lingering in a dusty drawer (or computer file), that he brought out, dusted off, and decided to put it out there for publication.  I can only hope that he has a few more tales to dust off and put out there, because I want to see what else lurks in the darkness of his brain.","03 18, 2013",A231LBC8EGPO5L,"OutlawPoet - In a Corrupt Stew ""OutlawPoet""",1363564800

It added in more elements of the original story, you get a takes of Glinda, some `flying monkeys', and other mystical creatures that all over sexed and aren't ashamed of it. Let me tell you, if I had known that Oz was the land of sex, I would have hopped on the first Twister and taken my happy butt there a long time ago.I think this story had more of a pleasing effect on me because of the light bondage and spanking that was in it.

He works from his Minnesota home. He is withdrawn and rather taciturn. Actually, he lives like a hermit because of his horrible childhood. His safe routine is blown to pieces when the daily sight of an unknown woman walking her dog sends his feelings in a turmoil.Jenny Fitzgerald's sex life is non-existent. The only guy who wants to date her is a creepy man named Evan. Evan is her co-worker and a mean guy. And then some day the love god sends her...this yummylicious specimen of a hot, sweet, AND shy man! This Nordic god standing in the middle of the path in a snowstorm is William. For a few days they go out for a walk with Jen's dog Rosie. Eventually, she 'invites' him on a date...Will's obvious fascination with her, his single-minded focus on her, makes her feel beautiful and interesting. His fixation on her is a bit disconcerting but hard to resist nevertheless!I really liked this book. The main couple is very sympathetic and there are good secondary characters as well. I truly LOVED Chris, the gay guy. He was so funny! The dialogs were good and hilarious - especially between Chris and Jenny. The hero was so taciturn, there wasn't really much room to develop exceptional dialogs. Of course I have to say that Will's dialogs fit him perfectly. He wasn't much of a talker and he was insecure and shy, therefore his answers were always short. His demeanor was very endearing - such a sweet guy! And he didn't even realize how hot he was! The sex scenes...gosh, they were really steamy and both of them were heating up the shower AND the sheets. I was so surprised to see how experienced the hero was when it came down to sex. I mean he was a virgin. Obviously, he learned a lot while watching certain movies. *cough*The beginning of this story was superb and I was totally hooked. And it reminded me a bit of Barbara Elsborg's books. Later on the pace slowed down and the plot didn't move forward as I'd have expected. But suddenly I had to read about this near-rape scene and the plot moved at a faster pace. Again.If you read the blurb then you know that this book contains a realistic, violent near-rape scene. Be prepared for an utterly nail-biting, heart-stopping, and thrilling scene of agony. When I read this particular scene, I truly felt for Jen, I hurt for her and I told myself over and over again ""When will it be over and when will the hero come to her rescue??"" Actually, when Will came and rescued Jen, I felt a tremendous relief!What didn't work for me:The author could have exploited the potential of this story much more. We know that Will had a rather horrible childhood. This topic could have been explored way better and I wanted more background story about Will. I wanted more insight, I wanted to know what goes on in his head. Sure, the author gave us a few glimpses but I just felt that it required further 'explanations'. Furthermore, I wanted him to open up completely, and I was waiting for his meltdown in front of Jen. The main couple never discussed his being a `virgin'. Will didn't tell Jen about his virginity. He was such a sensitive guy and I wanted to read about such a particular and important scene. I wanted him to ""Break the Silence"". The author didn't let that happen. Unfortunately. That's my biggest regret. Additionally, the whole marriage proposal felt a bit too rushed - it didn't ring true to me.Loved those 'lines':[...]""Sorry, Will - force of habit. And you're way too pretty to resist.""""Try."" Jenny took Will's arm and tugged him out of Christian's reach. ""I still haven't forgiven you for stealing my last potential date away from me.""Christian looked blank. ""Who?""""Trevor? Bike messenger guy? Ringing any bells?""""Oh please,"" Christian scoffed. ""If you don't want me to steal them, then don't go out with closet cases.""Will's muscles tightened at this, his shoulder blades pulling together.""Don't worry."" Christian must have noticed the small movement. ""I can tell you're as straight as an arrow. The flirting before was just...staring through the candy shop window without a penny in my pocket, that's all."" [...][...]Sometimes, she thought wryly, talking to Will was like playing twenty questions.[...]Overall, Breaking the Silence is an entertaining and engrossing read.

938,B003MNGE84,"[3, 5]",5,"The first book in the Infinion series established a good and original premise which had me anticipating the release of this sequel.  Book two begins 26 years in the future from the previous book just a few weeks from the approach of the series' all-important date Nov. 11, 2011.  It rapidly becomes clear that the Three Eleven Corporation has had an even more profound impact on the world in the last two and a half decades.  The beginning of the book offers some answers and builds good anticipation of what is going to happen between several of the central characters.  Unfortunately, many of these interactions fall flat.  Much was made in the first book of Adya's (Dawn's) call to motherhood and her extremely high IQ.  Although she has the education and experience of a master parent she is portrayed as a terrible mother in this second installment.  She seems very distant from her children, especially with the most important one who she neglects throughout the book.  I also got an overall impression that fatherhood is treated as inconsequential.  Dawn spends a good deal of the book pushing her lover completely out of her life while lamenting his distance.  Strange biases creep into the narrative.  At one point a character applauds himself thinking of himself as: ""leaving behind typical Caucasian ignorance.""  Not too subtle there.  And this guy is supposed to be a good guy, who happens to be Caucasian!Although the world's fateful day is approaching, it is hard to determine the passage of time here.  People are flying all over the world from this location to that location, often with little purpose or some obscure purpose.  It gives a very disjointed feel to the flow of the narrative when the reader is not sure why the characters are heading somewhere or what their next move should be.  At one point something happens that it would seem pretty important that the central characters react to but it seems not to be pursued to its natural conclusion at all.  During these tumultuous times for the planet, Dawn, the leader of Three Eleven essentially goes AWOL a couple of times during the book simply because she's upset about things going on.  She completely withdraws and provides no confidence to the rest of the Executive.  Three Eleven was ominous enough in the first book, but now has become terrifyingly powerful.  The corporation has effectively become a world government in the form of global nanny state controlling people's entertainment, food, money, technology, et cetera.  They are still presented as the good guys but they seem to have no redeeming qualities.  They keep people from having much junk food, or the latest technology.  The average person doesn't need the good stuff, right?  They may be trying to save the world but it is no longer a world people are free in.  Despite this the vast majority of the populace seems to be enthralled with the unrestricted intrusion of the corporation into most facets of their lives, to the point that many still express a desire to work for them!  The major exceptions to this are a man who blows things up and a crack pot conspiracy theorist.I am disappointed in the plot here.  We do learn much more about the plasmid and the threat to Earth and these things have some cool ideas thrown in there.  The concept has so much potential and even some new elements with much potential continue to be introduced here to Bell's credit.  But these are not able to overcome the fractured storytelling, deeply flawed characterizations, and scattered plot.  The train really flies off the tracks when Dawn goes and visits the buffalo spirits.  No, that's not a joke.  I'm a bit of a completist, so I'll still read the final installment for closure but it won't be with nearly the anticipation of this one.","11 2, 2010",A3TELA7GOWPFYM,E. Baxter,1288656000

He is a private investigator who knows how to get to the bottom of any problem that comes his way. Jones is extremely capable and efficient as he sniffs out a crime in order to bring about some kind of justice in his own unique way. In this fictional novel, Jones remains unintimidated by some heavy duty, mob connected individuals...and refuses to cower in the presence of some very descriptive crime scenes.

2850,B0035LC6I0,"[14, 20]",5,"First off, this is not a shape-shifter story, which I expected from the cheesy cover and the title.  It's a surprisingly uninspiring short story about an apparently very conflicted woman being forced into the company of the man she had walked out on the day before their wedding, many years earlier.This book was a freebie, but even at that price I'm ambivalent as to whether or not it was worth it.  The female lead character, Kasie, was unremarkable, and seemed to obsess on imaginary conflict where none existed.  The male lead, Chayton, was not much stronger.  I found it annoying that he demanded that Kasie cook and work around the cabin when he had kidnapped her and held her at his snowed-in cabin against her will. He seemed to think that her initial refusal to ""pull  her weight"" made her a brat, but it was actually her repeated complaints about her parents' trying to ""control her life"" that made her a whiny brat.Kasie's weak character was more and more annoying as the book went on, but when she finally meets up with her father after many years of estrangement, she acts almost as though her total lack of contact never happened.  If she was that annoyed over all those years about her father ""controlling her,"" she would not have been able to warm up to him or his new wife that quickly.  Basically, the author manufactured Kasie's feeling she was ""controlled"" by her parents to create some sort of tension in the story, a conflict to be overcome, but it's just too contrived to be believable.The ending was awkward, with Chayton suddenly acting entirely out of character compared to how he behaved in the prior 95% of the book, with no explanation for why he changed so dramatically from one scene to the next.  And what 26 year old woman is still a virgin, especially when she is supposedly about to marry a famous, handsome rock star, and who thinks she would prefer to just live with him instead?  The author seemed to require that Kasie remain chaste all those years away after she left Chayton and her father, however it was fine that Chayton had had ""his share of flings!""

Howie. They'd met once when Katie was thirteen and Howie about sixteen and the scrawny, nerdy brainiac didn't exactly endear himself to her.

As they get reacquainted and find out they have quite a lot in common, a new friendship and sparks of attraction fly fast and hard. Maybe their mothers weren't such horrible tyrants after all. And maybe it's true...love is really always in the last place you look.I had a pretty good idea very early into this novella that I wasn't going to be as happy with it as I'd hoped. Her sister not only stole her boyfriend, but is marrying him a year later. That's just skanky. And while Katie is now over it, I couldn't help but genuinely loathe her sister for that...and for every single scene she was in. The spoiled, petulant witch needed to have her bouquet stuck somewhere far less pleasant, let me tell you.But the story isn't about her sister. It's about Katie and Jackson. They were fine characters, though a little two dimensional. There's not a lot of time to develop characters in short novellas such as this, though, so I'm pretty forgiving about that. I'm less forgiving about the cliched aspects of the plot (five minutes in and I knew exactly when I'd see Katie and her ex come face to face), and as a reader, I hate romances that shove strangers together and have them falling in love and getting engaged days after meeting (or, as in this case, re-meeting). I'm all for Happily Ever After, don't get me wrong, but it's so hard to maintain a suspension of disbelief in those cases. It didn't work for me at all.The wedding festivities were, admittedly, over the top with the hijinks, but there was also plenty of humor there and I did appreciate how Jackson handled some of Katie's less than pleasant relatives and a few dicey situations. In fact, I don't have any complaints about either of them as characters and am forgiving of most of the constraints that the novella-length story put on the plot. It was the overall concept of the plot, the wretched sister from hell, and the completely implausible culmination of their weekend that I didn't like.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","01 5, 2011",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",1294185600

The hero just wants the heroine out of there, because she is too ""human"" and doesn't know anything supernatural.  The heroine is just stupid.  She never catches on to anything that is going on around her-she has a lot of curiosity, then is scared and can't think for most of the book.  She is entirely run by her emotions.

No. Even the secondary characters of a witch and her niece (also a witch) are either completely uncommunicative, or just don't know what is going on (a witch, really?)

Written by Jonathan Maberry, this introduction spoke of the slow distillation of the genre by which slasher and thriller films/stories taint/dilute the brand and served as the perfect entree to the pure horror stories penned by Scott Nicholson. `Ashes' kicks off with `Homecoming' a spooky and heartfelt ghost story where a farmer's son (along with other sprits) returns from the dead for one conversation. The next, `Haunted' - surreal and suspenseful, full of dread and awkward wonder in which the inhabitants of a once burnt out home are haunted by the people who fell victim to the flames. `The Christening' tells the short tale of abandoned mother to be in isolation both in geographically and emotionally who is haunted by an unusual spirit on a farm - so well defined and atmospheric that I could smell the drew on the cool grass amongst the farm backdrop. `She Climbs a Winding Stair' is a ghost story (see the reoccurring theme here?) of a beauty lost at seas who comes ashore seeking souls to accompany her in the murky ocean depths. Set amongst a ghost story isolated on an inhibited island, this was by far the best story in the collection. Rounding out the collection `Must See to Appreciate' is real-estate horror which throws in a moment of horror before an abrupt end, and `Three Dollar Corpse' which, much like `...Winding Stair' is a favourite of the collection set in a civil war prison camp where inmates make a living by burying the dead and scavenging their possessions. All in all a very solid collection sure to entertain and scare the reader just enough to keep things interesting - 3.5 stars.","07 11, 2011",A2M6FSR8G4L3KD,OzNoir,1310342400

She's been practically ostracized by many of the members of the Halle pride and injured severely enough to require a steel pin in her leg - which means that she can't shapeshift until they're removed.  The last thing she needs is more complications but that's exactly what she gets in the form of an Alpha wolf named Rick Lowell.Rick Lowell is the Alpha of the Red Wolf Poconos Pack.  He isn't exactly having an easy go of things here lately.  He's been shot, killed a rogue, found his mate, learned of her injuries, and now been told that he cannot take her home.  Why? Because she's Puma and the Wolf pack has to be prepared to accept a non-Wolf Luna.  He could handle all that but throw in an uppity dominant female looking to take over as Luna and things are bound to get very interesting.Belle has no doubt that Rick is her mate but she's not a push over and he's a little too full of himself for her taste.  Besides her doctors are in Halle and therefore she'll be staying put for the time being - possibly until the pin in her leg can be removed.  Rick's not willing to wait that long though, once the cast comes off he wants her with him - and it will still be another six months before she'll be able to shift.Belle's all for starting her life at Rick's side but she's not at all ready to take on Gina and her demands for full protocol.  Fortunately Belle isn't afraid to fight for what's hers and if that means taking on one conniving bitch then she'll use every means at her disposal to ensure that she comes out on top.  Rick is aware of just how devious Gina is and he's willing to take whatever steps necessary to ensure that Belle's transition into the pack is as smooth as possible and that she be allowed to recuperate before facing Gina and her challenge.  He shouldn't have worried.  Even being unable to shift, Belle is more than capable of facing down Gina and she does it with such style that you'll be left with no doubt that this `cat' is far superior to the `dog.'  Belle's the perfect match for Rick, but what will happen when Gina's plans push Rick and Belle into making decisions that could have disastrous results?Just when I thought the HALLE PUMA series couldn't get any better, it does!  STEEL BEAUTY is the fourth book in this delightful series and revisiting these characters is a pleasure you won't want to pass up.  This story is infused with humor, some real kick butt action, a memorable romance and proof that cats and dogs can be friends - and so much more. Belle won me over with her `in your face' attitude and the hilarious way she taunts Gina - as well as Rick.  She's not a gal who's going to let anyone get away with anything and I adore that about her.  Rick is exactly the sort of man Belle needs, he's just got to learn to share problems and worries - and she is chock full of ways of ensuring that he doesn't forget that she is his life partner.If you haven't read the other titles in this series, I'd highly recommend doing so - not because it's necessary to understand this book but because they're delightfully fun.

Some reviewers are arguing that this shouldn't be listed as a romance, I disagree with that as well, just because one half of the couple bites it (almost literally) doesn't disqualify the romantic aspect of the relationship, it's only love if both people make it? I think a lot of people are upset that there's no happily ever after in this book because that's what they've come to expect from a lot of UF novels, I much prefer the more realistic approach of this author, life and love most oft do not end the way we would like it to.I particularly like the authors writing style, he manages to convey emotion and emphasis sometimes with only few sentences composed of less than five words, stripped down to just the facts which functions much like a slap to the face, I find that this sometimes manages to convey more than the purple prose so many authors are fond of employing. Not to say that he doesn't at times get prosey, he does, however, when he chooses to do so it's appropriate and adds rather than detracts from the tale.  People complained about the violence and the drug use, but you know what, there are people out there that have lived and still live like that, kids like Molly who are snatched from their parents and forced into the sex trade, just because it makes people uncomfortable to know about it or read about it, doesn't negate it's existence.All of that is not t say that I didn't check out at some points in the novel, the excessive (and prosey) back story on Theroen bugged me and I did skip sections of it (only to come back and read it), but it does explain a good amount of the character's motivations and actions. The section where Molly was introduced was also a very difficult part for me, having volunteered with severely abused women and children most of whom had been trafficked from China, I'll admit to having a nightmare or two for a few days after reading and I had to set the book aside for a bit. The one thing that bothered me perhaps the most, was that Two decided to return to help Molly and the others only after she lost Theroen, her vampirism and needed to take Darren down for some quick cash. I almost stopped reading when she was rationalising away all the reasons why she shouldn't return for them. It would also have been good to understand why of everyone else, Theroen picked Two and what had been his criteria for doing so, had he been watching her? If so, for how long?Was this a good read? Yes. Would I recommend it to someone else? Definitely.

4742,B002IKKMAS,"[0, 0]",5,"Despite her pronounced limp, Professor Briony Swift is extremely good at her job so she's stunned when two of her A students hand her drop class requests.  She can't deny that seeing Nic and Leo in class every day has been a pleasure.  They're certainly the stars of many of her more erotic fantasies but they're students and therefore off limits.Nic Potter and Leo Phelps only enrolled in Briony's class so that they could get closer to her.  Neither of them needs the credit for her class in order to graduate and they feel it's time to make their true intentions toward Briony known.  They've seen her watching them and are aware that her desire for them is as strong as theirs is for her but there are ethics involved and convincing her to give them a chance is going to be more complicated than they initially thought.Nic and Leo's feelings for Briony go beyond sexual desire.  They honestly want to build a future with her.  However, their initial approach and suggestion that they have dinner together doesn't go over so well - especially once Nic blurts out the full extent of their sexual plans for her.  Briony's intelligent enough to know that the classroom is her safe haven and any non-academic involvement with Nic and Leo will be frowned upon.  That doesn't stop her from fanaticizing about them though.  Be that as it may, it's only a matter of time before she caves in to her own desires and takes Nic and Leo to her bed.  Just when it looks like they could possibly have a future together disaster strikes and their secret rendezvous are discovered.  Faced with the choice of career or her men Briony has some heavy decisions to make.Brynn Paulin's TWO PLUS ONE dives headfirst into the quandary of ethics versus desire.  Briony's a wonderful teacher who has always toed the line when it comes to her career.  Nic and Leo initially appear to be nothing more than college students hell bent on bedding the teacher but as you'll discover there's much more to them than meets the eye.  What I love about this story is watching Briony grow from a jittery unsure woman to one who stands up for herself and what she believes to be right.  Her disability and her career has been a crutch for her for so long that she's lost sight of what could truly make her happy so it brought a smile to my face to imagine Nic and Leo's determination to make her see herself the way they see her.  TWO PLUS ONE is one hot story full of steamy sex, raw sensuality and lots of little surprises as this trio works toward finding a way to build a future together.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","01 20, 2011",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

I thought ""Yay me.....ex-cop chases down nemesis killer, kills him.. so much fun. But since I paid for it, I figured I would give it a try maybe it won't be so bad.What I found beside horrible kindle formatting was a book that drew you in with amazing details and descriptions, characters you grew understand and sympathize with, yes even the bad guys made you empathize with them. What intrigued me the most was that the heroine, Andrea, was almost bad enough to be the bad guy with her tormented past. I had never read a book that made me wonder if the good guy was going to go to the ""dark side"" but this one did. It left me guessing on the reasoning behind why Andrea was there.. to kill Clive or to join him. The small town of Twilight came alive inside my head the town people, back water Louisiana types took on a life of their own in the story.The book is ultimately about broken people, what leads them to be what they are and the choices they make to lead them into the future. It does contain graphic material on incest and child abuse, if you can't handle those subjects do not read this book as they are an intricate part of the story line.The story line was a slow dreamy pace that built up into a huge climatic ending that left you kind of sad but sated with how it ended.

Unfortunately, I didn't get it.Detective Inspector James McBride's life is a mess and he doesn't know how to fix it. He's forty years old, divorced and not quite at peace with his sexuality. On the professional front, things don't look good either: his current undercover assignment has him pretending to be an alcoholic and gambling addict in order to infiltrate and bust a human-trafficking ring, but not all the drinking he's been doing lately is exactly necessary to do his job. Needless to say, he ends up blowing his cover and is taken off the case.Reassigned to look after the visiting Israeli ambassador, which is a constable's job and thus unworthy of his rank, McBride feels an instant connection with Tobias Leitner, the leader of the Israeli security team. McBride should know better than to get involved with Toby, who's still recovering from the death of his partner and lover, but fate, in the form of an unexpected brush with death and the kidnapping of McBride's daughter Gracie, conspires to get them together. Can they rescue Gracie, defeat the bad guys, survive to tell the story, and heal one another's heart in the process?Phew, this was not a light read! The story had a dark tone and none of the characters was particularly nice. I didn't like McBride, I didn't get to know Toby well enough to either like or dislike him, and as a result, I didn't care about their relationship. I liked the action scenes, but I don't read romances for them.The plot was too complex to fit the constraints of a novella, and that affected the development of McBride and Toby's romance. In fact, I felt that the focus of the story was McBride's downfall and recovery, and his relationship with Toby was just an afterthought. If I had to classify this book following the rules I know, I'd have to create a new genre: women's fiction with a male character as protagonist. As I'm not a fan of women's fiction and having a man as protagonist makes no difference to me, this book failed to grab me.","02 24, 2011",A8BE8Q59EXJCS,"Dina ""Dina""",1298505600

The night before her wedding, the two sneak out unchaperoned for one last sisterly moment of bonding, when the unthinkable happens and they are kidnapped by two wandering Vikings. They believe Gwendolyn to be male (in men's clothing and short hair) and take the duo back to their ship in repair, even though it is expressly forbidden by the captain, Hakon. From here on out, the story is about Hakon and his interaction with the 'brother' Garric and sister Anora.

As most of these stories go, I thought I could have predicted what happened, but unfortunately, I think my assumption was probably a better story than this. I found the story to be trite, shallow, messy, and incredibly misogynistic. I know well that most romance stories have a bit of misogyny in them, but this one was pretty thick with it.Let me start with the storytelling. It's messy in that it is constantly vacillating point of views. One paragraph is through Gwendolyn's eyes, the next is Hakon, and then the next one is some chambermaid in the same room giving her $0.02. So it goes on. It took me many chapters to get used to it. And yes, I did read the whole thing (mainly in hopes to see a redeeming quality in the couple).And the descriptions, whoa. Adverbs stacked on adjectives stacked on adverbs. I like description, but most of it felt forced or trite, as if there was a book of synonyms on the ready for *every* sentence.Also, the beginning of the story held a lot of completely unnecessary crap. If the story is not going to be about Wulfgar and Anora, maybe one should stop writing such intricate details about their history and the political notions of it all. When it doesn't last past the first few chapters, never to be touched upon again, I feel like my time is wasted with pointless words completely lacking in entertainment or reason.The twins' ruse was poorly written. I believe another reviewer noticed the same. How can the both be so incredibly fair and beautiful and gorgeous and gifts of the gods when one can be so easily mistaken for a young boy? I absolutely hated Hakon as a character, but it was laughable to read the spew of compliments he would bestow upon Anora, then hate so easily on Garric without any inkling of her identity, then praise Gwendolyn (as Anora) exactly the same - never the wiser! Yet every chapter some background character made a comment on how absolutely magnificent and awe-inspiring was the beauty of either...but only if they were in a dress. /eyeroll/ Put some pants on a girl and she's too mannish to believed to be a girl. Riiiiight.Now to the 'romance' of Gwendolyn and Hakon. Not once did I feel any genuine love between the two. For chapters, Hakon praises his affections and lust for Anora, from the very beginning. When they are first discovered on the ship, the reader anticipates a kind captain with morals, but instead the reader gets an arrogant warrior who's okay with raping and taking some hostages as slaves. While I get his reasons for not turning around and dropping the twins back off at England, did he really have to enforce slavery? Not only slavery, but insist on getting Anora to bed him as some kind of sex slave (incredibly confidently, I might add). I get that this was probably exactly the kind of man one would expect in this era, but it's not very attractive to read about in a romance novel. So not only is he constantly forcing his affections on an incredibly frightened Anora and just scaring the bejeezus out of her with his talks of forcing himself upon her, but he doesn't even get a whiff of difference when Anora and Gwendolyn change places. Absolutely nothing is amiss to him. The first night Hakon and Gwendolyn (as Anora) are together...it's just very...rape-y. He does force himself...but it's some kind of weird thing that Gwendolyn (all this time has completely hated and disgusted by this guy) just turns over like a cat in heat all of a sudden. I think, as a reader, one is supposed to just accept that her body knows what's best for her heart...or something like that? Even through the realization of love and all that, Hakon never knows who's who. I mean, I would think true love should at least be able to see a person past their indescribably beautiful body to fall in love with someone and then fall in love with an identical someone without realizing the difference. It just leaves the romance's credibility in the negative.This also applies to Gwendolyn. The reader does not come across her transition into loving him. She's wishy washy and just moody. She hates him because he took her and her sister as slaves away from her homeland! She loves him because he's great in the sack! She hates him because he's so mean to her when she's Garric. She loves him because just look at that hot, Viking body! Once she starts pretending to be Anora, all plans to escape home are just gone. Months are supposed to go by, and Anora is just sitting on her thumbs trusting her sister. I just don't get it. I don't get any precourse to love beyond lust or obligation/duty/honor above whatever it is that feels good.I mentioned the first scene of intimacy between Hakon and Gwendolyn are...rape-y. Well, the acceptance of rape was one of the biggest themes that disturbed me. It wasn't outright acceptance, per se, but it was darn close. The constant attempts to rape the twins were disheartening, but then to have the 'hero' consider it so much...yeah, not cool. One line from a background character left me doing double takes:""Whatever happened to the days when a Viking chieftain took a wench if he wanted her, and that was that! She closed her heavy-lidded eyes, a secret smile on her face, as she remembered her youth.""This particular quote in context implies that Hakon should just go ahead and rape Anora, because he's so good looking and rich and a spectacular lover, the rape will be null and void because the wench in question will love it.Yeah...this is just a horrible impression for a romance novel...and towards the 'good guy' especially.Again, I believe another reviewer also noticed the abundance of Gwendolyn's stupidity. Keep getting in trouble by walking around alone? Just keep doing it! Yeah! Not only is it a poor setup for danger, but it's also poor characterization. Need the heroine to come across the bad guy? Just write in there that she's walking around for funsies. Maybe she can not learn her lesson and do it again later...a few more times, at that.There was one line in an (albeit decent) scene of war: ""Acting on finely honed instincts..."" referring to Gwendolyn in fight. I literally laughed out loud. ""Finely honed"" indeed.A great line that's later in the book, after already been in danger numerous times:""Perhaps a walk would take her mind off the memories that continually plagued her. Aye, that was what she would do!""Such excitement for a walk!!! She must know that danger and excitement are ahead whenever she goes out alone! Good one, Gwennie!So why two stars instead of one? I read the whole thing and still hoped for a romantic redemption. I really wanted Hakon to be a decent guy. I really wanted true love to peek it's cute little head and yell, ""Surprise! I really AM here!"" If the story was just an outline, I would have enjoyed it better, because I really do like the premise. If only I had a trophy in poor execution...Lacking characters, lacking writing, overwrought descriptions, glorifying rape, zero hero/heroine presence...and thusly.Thank Odin it was free.","11 30, 2012",AWY2E5OJWN9JS,Amazon Customer,1354233600

I consider Torn tabloid fanfiction, a what if about a well known and successful married movie star falling in love with his married co-star. Sound like anybody you know? He is in the tabloid marriage of the century but he is also unhappy and desperately want kids that his showbiz wife want give him. Now do you know him? His co-star got the part on a fluke, she is happily married to her husband of 10yrs, but as the story unfolds there are hidden issues that will be brought to the light that can no longer be ignored as their marriage unravels. One is the desire to have more children, she wants more he doesn't. How do we get to a HEA, is it possible?If you hate cheating or marriage infidelity you will not like this book. Ty and Chelsea are married to other people when they get together. Chelsea had a good marriage to a good man, they have 2 little girls that they both love, how can she risk it all for what many would call a pipe dream. And Ty although he is at the end of his marriage how could he let his guard down to get involved with a married woman. At times their romance was sweet but it was also extremely selfish. Chelsea's husband Jake had his faults, how he dealt with being the cuckold husband was hilarious at times and also bittersweet. When Chelsea was trying to explain to Jake why Ty is her soul mate he was thinking....""He was going to run screaming like a woman from the ambulance, and probably choke a biotch on his way out."" The author has a talent for making the reader feel two opposing emotions at the same time. Your heart is breaking because a marriage is ending but on the flip side it had its funny moments. The supporting cast of characters helped move this story along and gave it depth. The old adage..less is more..applies to the sex scenes. The sex is hot but it does not take center stage, the emphasis is on the relationships that are formed.Relationships can be messy, this book dealt with a messy subject, you will either love or hate Chelsea and Ty, they are far from perfect. There were moments I hated both of them and pitied Jake, but in the end I really liked them all. Christina Brunkhorst wrote one heck of a page turner, you will be flipping pages like crazy to see how this story will end.","04 29, 2012",AHWEFT97VZ7FB,"Ms Daisy ""Ava""",1335657600

Mr. Shepard has done a commendable job of distilling what are, after all, fragments and pieces of stories, into a reasonably coherent tale. He has also done a nice job of preserving the feel and flow of the tales while modernizing the language and shaping the narrative.And remember, these are basically 800+ year old versions of the same fantasy/quest/magic stories that fill the middle grade shelves now.

It is a gripping story about sex slavery, focusing on Callie, aka Mischief, a young girl kidnapped while vacationg in Europe. The tale is told by her, first in her current situation where she is being held by the police who are trying to figure out who she is and what is wrong with her; and secondly about her time in the facility called Judgment.I do not normally enjoy flashbacks in my books, but they are present throughout this one, and I found them to be short and extremely important to the rest of the story. Mischief has undergone extreme conditioning, over the span of ten + years, which explains her behavior with the detectives. The rest of the book is spent describing her experiences at Judgment, which consisted of many colorfully described beatings with just about every implement available by just about every Master in the place (and there are quite a few).There is some sex here and there, and even a quick f/f scene, but it isn't focused on or described nearly as much as the overall behavior modification and the techniques the Masters employ to produce ""finished products"" for sale.

It had the possibility to be pretty good but the execution wasn't there.First of all it seemed like the author just took a little bit of vampire lore from every vampire story there is.  Which wouldn't be bad in itself, except that I felt like it was almost a parody at times.  Kinda like that movie ""Vampire's Suck"" that makes fun of all the vampire movies.I REALLY, really, really, did not like the ""heroine"" of this story.  I don't even like calling her that. She had no depth, and was a spoiled, self-centered, vapid young girl.  She had no brains, and might as well have walked around with a sign on her neck saying, ""Here I am come kill me!""  Her character is really what made this book awful.Here's the story:Brian is a vampire and lives across the street from ""the girl of his dreams"".  (I think this exact phrase was used at least 10 times in the story, although I really think it must have been nightmares!)  Besides the usual vampire powers (strength, speed, agility, and mind control) he can dream walk and spirit walk.  He's pretty obsessed with Heather (the girl across the street).  He basically stalks her dreams and follows her around in a spirit walk.  The book starts off where he is spirit walking and follows her to an abandoned home where she and her friends like to party.  Heather leaves the party just as men in suits come to haul all of her friends off.  (We don't know where.)  Brian ""suggests"" that Heather come to his house so that he can keep her safe.  Their journey begins as they try to escape the mysterious agents who have been tracking them down.  The weird thing is that they aren't after Brian (because he's a vampire), they are actually after Heather (although I don't know why, she could make anyone want to just gag her and put her in the trunk).I felt like Brian was a pretty accurate description of a teenage boy- hungry all the time and thinking about sex when he wasn't eating.  I really never understood what he saw in Heather except that she was beautiful.  (Which again, would be true to form for a teenage boy).This is not something I would want my pre-teen daughter to read, because of the way that the female lead was portrayed and some mild sexual content.","03 8, 2011",A1JJ4O649OQNXS,"C.K.

1679,B002F3PPVE,"[0, 0]",5,"My Soul to Lose is a novella set in the world of author Rachel Vincent's Soul Screamers series prior to the events that take place in the first full-length book in the series, My Soul to Take.Told from the perspective of the main character in the series, Kaylee Cavanaugh, it gives readers a short glimpse into her life prior to her discovery of who and what she is. In this story both readers and Kaylee are unaware of just what is wrong with her and why she has debilitating ""panic attacks"" that cause her to scream uncontrollably, to see things that shouldn't be there, and that leave her hoarse, terrified and questioning her sanity.And while the novella creates more questions than provides answers, it does introduce readers to Kaylee and gives them a look at a heroine who is in many ways a normal, frightened teenage girl who just wishes none of this was happening to her, but who is also strong and selfless and who manages to retain her sarcasm and sense of humor through it all.My Soul to Lose is an exciting and immensely entertaining introduction to this series. It develops the main character and teases the world enough for readers to want to know more. It gives readers a feel for the author's writing style and gives them a peek at several characters who will make an appearance in later books in the series.Whether the novella is read prior to having read any or all of the full-length books in the series or not, it will be captivating and intriguing, humorous and heartbreaking, a little bit shocking and most definitely eye-opening.While My Soul to Lose can be read at any point during the series, reading it prior to the first book offers a very different experience for readers than reading it at any point thereafter. But for new readers and fans of the series alike, this novella is an absolute must read.","06 14, 2012",A1ZHEK7NJJWKE9,Fiktshun,1339632000

First it is a historical (my favourite romance genre) and two it is an Eloisa James novella (whom I adore) and three A Fool Again is linked to her Duchess Quartet Series which I also loved.So what happened with A Fool Again? I didn't like Genevieve after the first chapter, I was luke warm towards Lucius Felton and I just couldn't understand why the heck why Tobias held a torch for Genevieve after all those years. I mean, he only talked to her for a few hours before they tried to elope to Gretna Green. They were young, perhaps a little drunk but could her beauty really last in his memory for him to pine for her all the years he was in India?Even after Tobias returns from India and moves to reacquaint himself with Genevieve, besides her beauty, what was he seeing that really attracts him?What I did like about A Fool Again was of course Eloisa James' writing. As always, it was wonderful and professional. Even if I wasn't a fan of the story plot, I very much enjoyed reading her style. I did like how she solved the conflict between the characters and I was pleased how it all came together in the end.","01 17, 2014",A38ZVXB1U9MINP,"M. Kelly ""Another Look Book Reviews""",1389916800

She notices a hot guy and insists on being introduced and even though he plays hard to get she goes after him.  She does suspect he may be a vampire and you will have to read to find out why.

Concise and brimming with very important information and wisdom, YOUR HEALTH - YOUR PH: HOW TO REVERSE ILLNESS AND GAIN VITALITY is a piece of work everybody should read. It shows you how to know your body pH levels and what to take away from this reading; how to pinpoint the problems your body is undergoing owing to low pH readings; how to reverse the deterioration caused; as well as how to non-physically arrest these debilitating issues through a certain mental frame of mind.Social/Historical Context:Okay, doctor visits can be costly, agreed. We collectively spend millions every year paying for these visits, and I am not talking of the many who are actually sick and need a cure. No, I am talking of those who can prevent their ailments had they known the many secrets of healthy living. And one of these secrets include that funny abbreviation called pH. Yes, how acidic or alkaline our body fluids are is very important to our body systems. Author Amy Mosher starts us on a journey we'll all be grateful for in her book, YOUR HEALTH - YOUR PH: HOW TO REVERSE ILLNESS AND GAIN VITALITY. How this journey ends depends entirely on us.Writing Style:Written in simple English, the book's intent is to convey its message without confusion, and it does this brilliantly. No muddled up scientific jargon, I tell you! Everything is laid out in nonprofessional terms, and when there is a need for some intellectual words, these are quickly broken down in the ensuing paragraphs.My Thoughts:A lot of research went into writing this book. I was impressed by this fact when I finished reading the book. Author Amy Mosher has done every one of us a favor by writing this book, and I mean it. Gosh, I never knew Aloe Vera is a healthy edible, that fish contains mercury, a highly acidic mineral, and that hydrogenated or trans fats are very bad news! And what of diet coke? I will be raising spoilers here if I continue, trust me!

4665,B002JGZAT4,"[5, 5]",5,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 6/10PROS:- I love the idea of eternal love and soul mates, and very few storylines can get away with that as easily as the ""werewolf meets his mate"" one. They see each other the first time and just know that they were made for each other. (see cons below also)- The characters are cheesy and stereotypical, but I must admit to finding a guilty sort of pleasure in reading about small, victimized men who are rescued by their heroic, strapping lovers. Sasha is THE stereotype of a helpless damsel in distress like those so popular in the bodice-ripping romances of years ago. And Vadim is, of course, the perfect Alpha. Strong and imposing yet utterly selfless and kind. He's quick to anger, but only when someone's being taken advantage of or he discovers injustice in the world.- There's never a shortage of action and drama in Glenn's stories. The characters get over one hurdle, have sex, get over another hurdle, have sex, misread each other and separate, make up and have sex, and so on.- This story takes the mental communication between werewolf mates to a deeper level than I've seen in other stories. I liked not only seeing Vadim and Sasha carry on entire conversations no one else can hear, but also seeing other mated couples engaged in discussions no one else is privy to and having to guess at what they're saying based on their body language.CONS:- As much as I love stories about werewolves and their life mates, the idea that a character can meet someone and automatically be in love with him seems to me like a lazy storytelling technique sometimes. The author doesn't have to put any effort into establishing an emotional connection or building up sexual tension. It's just there. Bang. In this story, the characters have performed the mating ritual (which is basically akin to marriage, with no option of divorce) before Sasha even knows Vadim's name.- The writing tends to be shallow and repetitive sometimes. This occurs near the beginning, for example: ""The little man was his now""...and then a few paragraphs later: ""The sexy man beneath the desk was no longer theirs. He belonged to Vadim now.""- The whole book reads like a first draft that was written in about 2 weeks and then never edited. There are obvious editing errors throughout, and the story incorporates a large number of clich&eacute;s and hackneyed phrases. Some of the typos are so blatant it seems like the author didn't even read the story over before it was published, much less an editor.Overall comments: Glenn's stories have a tendency toward over-the-top drama, as is evident at the end of the first paragraph of this story: the two main guys meet and immediately recognize that they're mates, and Vadim is ""stunned!"" (I didn't add the exclamation point; it's in the book.) But I keep reading her stories, because in spite of their soap-opera feel, they're entertaining little diversions.","10 24, 2010",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T. Anchor,1287878400

It is about Kaylee Cavanaugh, a high school student who sees shadow visions so frightening that they send her into debilitating panic attacks. When one of these attacks strike her in the local Sears store, Kaylee is restrained by security guards and rushed to the hospital. She awakens to find herself in the psychiatric ward. I don&#8217;t want to say too much here, because it is a short book and I don&#8217;t want to give too much away.This novella does a nice job introducing readers to Kaylee and her strange condition. By leaving the ending somewhat open, she left me wanting to read more (which is kind of the whole point to a prequel). This is the first book I&#8217;ve read by Rachel Vincent, and I&#8217;m impressed. Her characters are real teenagers, not perfect little &#8220;Bella Swans.&#8221; Her characters were interesting, but relatable.

She started contacting Bryan, but never got a reply. When she did get a reply Bryan said he didn't know her. Morgan was a music teacher. Her school district had to let her go because of budget cuts. Morgan packed up everything and moved to Chicago. She was going to see Bryan face to face and no one was going to stop her! When she got to Bryan's office, his sectary said that he was busy and told her to make an appointment. Morgan barged into a conference room, and asked to see Bryan. This handsome, tall man that she had never seen before said I am Bryan. Before she could retreat, her water broke, and her contractions were painful, keeping her rooted to where she stood. He picked her up and took her to his office and laid her on his couch. When she was in the office she saw a picture of the person she knew as Bryan, with the man that just said he was Bryan. She pointed and said that is Bryan, I want to see him now. Bryan said that is my brother Dillon, and I'm afraid you can't see him. Dillon died 6 months ago. Dillon would often take trips and use his brother's name, and his credit cards, leaving Bryan to clean up his mess. The ambulance came, and Bryan asked Morgan who he could call for her. She said no body.  Morgan was an only child, and both of her parents had died the month before Morgan took her trip to Aruba. The Cailborn family was very wealthy, so everyone thought Morgan was there as a gold digger. In truth she was there because she wanted her son to know his family. This story really touched my heart. When everyone finally trusted Morgan to be who she really was, everyone loved and accepted her. I loved it the first time she met Bryan's parents. There were tears shed.

Dean, however, wants a girl he can make a forever with.- My e-version had a number of proofreading issues. Enough to detract from the story, and wish the author had given just a little more attention to details.Opinion:One aggressive woman, one wary male - she wants a f**buddy, he wants a HEA. It's an interesting, different read, but in the end there just really isn't anything *special* about it. It's a nice enough read, and an interesting start to a series, but nothing overly remarkable. On the plus side, Dean being a firefighter is integral to the story. Unlike many books of the genre who claim ""Real Heroes"" as their Leading Man, the firefighting aspects actually *matter* and Dean really is a Hero. That's nice.

She can only imagine how happy they will be, and the anniversary vacation the trio has planned to leave for the next day will be the icing on the cake. The longer Catherine waits, however, the more she realizes she has been stood up once again for business. She soul searches and comes up with the only conclusion she can think of, and so heads out on her anniversary vacation alone.Logan and Rhys love Catherine, their wife, more than they ever thought possible.  Striving to make their business successful so she would want for nothing has been tough, and they've had to make a lot of sacrifices, especially where their marriage is concerned.  When a client unexpectedly requires their presence in another town, Logan and Rhys don't hesitate. They leave immediately, completely forgetting their dinner date with their wife.  Upon their return, Logan and Rhys immediately sense something is wrong.  It seems their home is empty, and their wife has left without them.Catherine has to do a lot of soul searching.  She loves her men unconditionally, but she is so very tired of being taken advantage of.  She knows she is more important than just a phone call, and so makes the decision to stand strong where her husbands are concerned.

8233,B002P8MQ0W,"[2, 2]",5,"I received a free copy of this book for review.There is something for every reader in this book. It was filled with action and adventure and the supernatural. At times, the novel reminded me of a mix of Indiana Jones and Stargate and, at other times, like supernatural stories of demons and ghosts.The characters were each distinct and there were many characters from different groups. At first, I didn't think I could keep track of them all, but each character developed his own persona as the book progressed and after a while it wasn't necessary to be told who was talking, from the natural-born leader, the Colonel, to the practical and knowledgeable policeman Murphy to the inexperienced novice Kate. This was true of the main group. Then, there were the baddies and the FBI. Some characters also had other names or variations on their names. Some sections were a little confusing and had to be re-read.The quest of finding a piece of the staff of Solomon was similar to finding clues in a good mystery novel. After reaching each one, the reader was anxious to read more. I found myself thinking about the story each time I laid the book down until I picked it up again, mostly trying to keep the characters and timeline straight.Different stories were weaved throughout the book from different times and different people as the story unfolded. Some sections of the story took place in a castle in the 16th century and others in the wild west with Frank and Jesse James while others were in modern times with a storyline of ritual killings. This presented no problem because the first paragraph provided enough clues that the reader knew who it was and what was going on, with the headings of the segment of the story being prefaced by the date. This was used as a mechanism to mete out all the information in spurts throughout the book, a way of showing how everything within the novel developed through time to the present day. It was a good technique and kept the reader from being overloaded with information.I prefer novels to have a definite conclusion, but this book is intended to be the first in a series and left the reader at a point where he or she wants to read the next book and the next or however many more there are until the story ends. As I said, if you like action and adventure, magic, ghosts, demons, quests and serials, you will enjoy this book.","06 24, 2013",A2KPIGI8Y25SRQ,Amber Fox,1372032000

8898,B003BEDV08,"[12, 13]",5,"**warning*** this review has some spoilersIt's not just the characters who are frustrated throughout the book, it was myself as well.I had high hopes for the story line, it was a novel approach and I enjoyed reading a romance from this time period set in Bath rather than in London. The main characters are engaging and the writing style is well done. But then the frustrations start.First of all,  Lady Iona is downright awful at anything approaching communication. She lets her family shut her up all the time, even when her very happiness depends on it. And then she constantly thinks about telling Nathan the truth about her father's plan to engage her to her cousin, but she never actually brings it up. It takes her forever to explain to him why she won't marry him. And then once he insists on the marriage, even after he's told her how impressed he is with her artwork and how he'll support her in the endeavor, she immediately starts assuming that he'll crush the happiness out of her and not let her do the things she wants to do. I have NO idea where she got that idea, and she never even asks him about it! I'm not really sure who she was rebelling against... it mostly seemed to be like she was rebelling against her assumptions rather than what people actually wanted/expected from her.Not that Nathan's much better at communication, but at least he tries to talk to HER even if he doesn't clear up things with his family - not that they're listening to him anyway.She's also more than a little bit selfish, but even once she realizes that she's behaving selfishly, she doesn't stop! And she behaves more than a little recklessly, putting herself in danger in ways that IF she truly had spent time helping women of the lower classes like she says she does, then she would know better. I understand wanting to make her seem innocent and naive, but in a lot of the situations she goes way too far and it just becomes ludicrous.And then we have the ridiculous about turn of her family.  Not only did her mother warn off Nathan from her - long before he had truly become a rake, and we never get a real explanation for that... unless the rumor about him ruining another girl was out beforehand? but even then, why would the DUCHESS be the one visiting and telling him that, shouldn't it be up to Iona's father? - but her father goes from punching Nathan in the face one night and insisting that she must marry her cousin as he's planned, to the next morning hearing Nathan out and then declaring that Iona must marry Nathan to save HIS reputation? Why on earth does her father suddenly believe Nathan's accounting of events? Out of freaking NOWHERE?!There is a good story within this book, unfortunately it's hampered by way too many obstacles which bog down the plot line, an overabundance of bad communication between characters (to the point where I almost put the book down because they were annoying me so much with their ridiculousness), and ludicrous turn-arounds from several of the side characters who suddenly start behaving supportive without any explained motivation. That being said; I did adore Lord Nathan and the end of his story was immensely satisfying. I just wish that Lady Iona and her family hadn't been so ridiculously eye-roll worthy.","10 15, 2012",AH3W1BMSY9G07,Lovemuffins,1350259200

He quickly surmised that the world was very different and very bloodthirsty, but every time he found something different he started to act up in so as to draw attention to himself and his companion, thus endangering their lives. He can't find all of his relatives in the registry, so he acts up in public. He discovers there are no libraries, so he goes running off in a huge distressed huff. For some reason he was totally surprised when his money was no good, even though he knew this world was dramatically different from his own.

While being familiar with the other series is NOT necessary, the writing and characters in this will have you searching out the other stories: this will certainly help to provide more insight into the connected worlds.Characters are beautifully defined and described, with personal insecurities and preferences that are easy to relate to and understand,  with conflicts  occurring as characters seek to overcome their differences and fears to make connections that are both imminently destined and oh so right.  There are sexy and sensual scenes that serve to enhance the connections between the characters so well defined and displayed by witty conversations and asides, obvious protectiveness and chemistry that is apparent to all.I received an eBook from the author for purpose of honest review.

As a reader some things I both liked and disliked.Traver's family honor and guilt drove the story. I thought there could have been other more appealing reasons that could have been more entertaining. Rusty being forced into a situation not of his making put a bit of a dampner on the story from the beginning for me. I became frustrated for him being stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to please everyone but himself.Leaving that subject behind some of the characters bothered me as well. I felt Deke became more insensitive and controlling toward Rusty and at times I wanted to stuff a sock in it. Maybe that is what Ms. Hestand wanted me to feel and if she did than it was accomplished.I kept feeling as if the author glossed over situations that could have been built upon making the story more spicy and entertaining. Examples: had she built on Jennifer's appearance and the situation that occured. It would have made for more substance had she built more drama around the character.  I wanted to see her pay and pay dearly for her manipulation.I liked the way  previous characters made steady appearances throughout all the series so a reader could keep up with the happenings of those characters. I liked the way Cal was portrayed as the family support system even though Deke took the helm.  Emma remained a strong female Matriarch and supportive character along with Sammy Jo making her appearances.  I got to know and like this family.All in all I was looking for more meat to the story but what I read was enjoyable and more than I could have ever done.

This story delivered more than I expected, and I enjoyed it more for that.The story follows six members of a Marine special ops team as they spearhead an assault on an enemy outpost on a distant world.  When they are cut off from their extraction point, they end up stranded deep underground where they find a huge derelict spaceship.  As they try to treat their injuries, resupply and seek a means of escape, they find that they are not alone.Almost all of the action is concentrated in the beginning and end of the book, but when the action starts, it is intense.  That's not to say that much of the book is dull as writer Michael Marks manages to drive the story with suspense and mystery.  The Marines' exploration of the ship reminded me of the scene in the movie Aliens where the Colonial Marines stalk through a deserted colony.  Marks writes well - his descriptions are very detailed.  Descriptions of the Marines' gear are also very detailed - enough to make them plausible, not outlandish.  Marks doesn't skimp on the science either.  The science behind the tech in the story is explained well - it's not the techiest that I've read, but it's enough to make it believable.I do have some gripes.  First of all, the characters are too cliched and not well developed.  Only one of the characters really comes out of this adventure a different person.  Some of the characters seem to be way too tough to be real.  However, thinking of all the stories of heroism and sacrifice by special forces soldiers, maybe it isn't so far fetched.

8852,B0035RPFE6,"[1, 1]",5,"*This is a 3.5 Review*When I was a little girl I used to keep a journal, not for normal reasons of course, (I'm way to unconventional for that) but to keep myself from running away.  See, while most girls were busy scribbling notes about boys and what dress they were going to wear to the dance, I was busy fighting off evil warlords or exploring sunken ships.  My writing was an escape, (it still is actually,) and because of it I was able to face down what I thought to be the more ""problematic"" issues of my adolescence. (How hard is a Geography test really gonna be after I just escaped from Hurtsalini -the Mistress of the Underworld's - death grip.) Since my awkward tween days I have stopped journaling, opting for a more ""grown up"" alternative (compiling the worlds longest bucket list) but regardless of the absence of my little green binder the thrill of creating my own world has never left me.In Stephanie Void's novel ""Running From Secrets"" Bethany (the heroine) takes the world of journaling to a whole new level.  Not only does she WRITE the story of her dreams, but after just a few pages, she finds herself LIVING it.""Bethany has never felt as alone as she feels in Linwood--until she dreams up Chime, a woman on the run because of a magic crime she didn't commit. The dreams get more and more urgent, so Bethany tries to banish them by writing them down, only to discover she's stumbled into the role of unwitting controller of Chime's world.Chime is real here, and so is the possessed queen, minion army, mysterious professor, Vault Five, wind chimes with a secret code, child's rhyme that can kill, the naked painting, and other things Chime's story leads her to.She has to fix the story without erasing Chime and her world, because if she erases Chime, she will die as well.""Ok, now...where to start.I guess the most important thing to get across to you (the potential reader) would be that ""I genuinely enjoyed this read.""  It was short, (probably a little too short for all of the features, loops and plot structures it combined,) but regardless of its length it delivered on the most basic of levels: keeping me entertained.That's not to say I didn't spot a few issues though.#1.  The transitions needed help.On more than one occasion I felt myself cringing at the flip between ""fantasy"" and ""real."" Both plot lines were important to the story but the seams connecting the two were choppy and (at times) misplaced. I know I have said this on more than one occasion, but it is important for authors to understand and acknowledge ""flow.""  If (for instance) your ""fantasy realm"" is in the middle of a major plot point, and you decided to pull your character back into ""real life"" with nothing but a # mark, you risk the chance of losing your readers attention.  Cleaning up one ""run"" before starting another is imperative. (I'm not saying settle the whole problem before you move on, just make the scenario solid before you do so.)#2. There were dialogue hiccups.Bethany's manner of speaking took on VERY different rolls depending on whom she was speaking to.  In interactions with her younger sister her words came across as grand-motherly and sophisticated, scroll a few paragraphs down (when speaking to a professor or her peers) her words would turn shy, flip the page and suddenly she was assertive and confident (this was around Chime.) With Bethany's dialogue taking on so many characteristics it was a little difficult to pin down her ""true self"" (if you catch my drift.)Overall however, (transitions and dialogue discrepancies aside) I thought the story was interesting, definitely original, and a hell of a lot of fun to read (without taking up too much of your time.)I think fantasy lovers will appreciate this one, for the rest of you it might be a hit or miss. (aka it reads mostly fantasy with only appearances of reality to break for Bethany's story structuring.)Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: if you build it they will come.","01 5, 2012",AFUQ93IMBSVR4,Misty Baker,1325721600
8972,B002TG4P22,"[1, 1]",5,"Our favorite gay medium, Vic Bayne, returns in the 2nd installment of the Psycop series. Unwilling to go back to his apartment where the incubus almost killed him and was turned into a mass of protoplasm (""Among the Living"", the first novel), Jacob has moved in with Vic and both are testing the waters of cohabitation. In each character's mind, they realize this may or may not be temporary as neither has broached the subject of actually living together. Vic's friend Lisa is now in training at PsyTrain, and he has been assigned a new partner, Roger Burke, a rather affable eager-to-please who accepts Vic and his sexuality all in stride. This all seems well enough, and things should be going well for Vic, except that his psychic ability has gone into hyperactive mode. The dead are now clearly visible everywhere, and they seek him out when he's around. Constantly reaching for him, he can actually physically feel them and starts to lose control and break down.It's a very enjoyable story. Vic is a wonderfully complex character, and his sarcastic wit gives the story a lighter edge when needed. As with any good story, Vic undergoes some growth, which adds to the empathy one can feel for him. Too many serial stories don't let their characters grow, trying to keep them the same as they were in the first book, so it's pleasant when you can see and chart the growth Vic is gradually going through. Other characters aren't quite as fleshed out as Vic is, but they're still interesting and enjoyable. The story stumbles a little at times by stretching plausibility (like the introduction of a device that lets Vic tune in or tune out spirits, which raises more questions as to the nature of the spirits than it answers), but overall, it's an immensely interesting and enjoyable novel.","04 18, 2010",A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP,"Robert Carnevali ""Typical, middle-aged guy""",1271548800

I just haven't found the right book, series, or author to drag me (willingly of course ;) into the M/M world. But I think Evangeline just did that for me.Plot wise, Str8te Boys isn't much of a read, but Maverick and Duke were so entertaining I honestly could care less what they did outside that apartment. I'm double daring these hotties to keep rubbing their big, muscular bodies and c***s to one another while making out with lust-filled hunger until they come on each other!Unholy hell... where are my ice buckets?!!!I thought the whole concept for ""gay chicken"" was ridiculous, especially considering that no straight man in his right mind would let another man touch his junk. But here's where thngs get interesting, because Duke and Mav have taken their ""game"" to extreme possibilities. I love that these guys are jocks. They've been playing in the same soccer team for the past four years (plus in my book, I love soccer players ;)), and they've been roomies and bff's since their freshmen year of college. Str8te Boys is told from Maverick's POV, and it's interesting because as ""uncomfortable"" as he gets when Dukes talks guy on guy action, he still allows him to get close. To play with his c*** to kiss, to lick... and so many other sinfully delicious things.Duke is suppose to be straight as well, according to Mav, but it didn't take long for me to begin to question these guys' sexual orientation, and then things really take off when Duke and Mav go to a photo shoot together. Basically a porn site for gay men with straight looking ones.The more Duke and Mav's relationship progresses, the more Mav begins to question his nature. Everything seems perfect for the two until a late night trip to the drugstore ends with Duke's heart being broken. Now, Mav must come to terms with who he truly is, or risk losing not only his best friend, but his heart as well.Like I said, the idea of ""Gay Chicken"" for me was ridiculous, but so very clever at the same time. Both Mav and Duke were great characters. I would have loved seeing some soccer action, and them interacting outside of each other. But the scenes were so delicious between these two I'll happily shut up as long as I get front row seats and touch action! *Rawr* ;) I'll be sticking to Evangeline Anderson for more sinfulness from now on.","05 4, 2013",A2JB33XTGRG2PA,"Love, Lust, Books",1367625600

I recommend the book to anyone who loves animals and imagines what it would be like to become one.  This may be the first story of a series, but each book stands alone.  I am currently reading the second book and so far the characters don't repeat.","01 5, 2012",A3KKFG3TA9IO8X,Diane Rapp,1325721600

This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot,the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior, but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice, but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.  So, I totally bought it and her not wanting to have sex with him but liking it because when she firsts meets him she's instantly attracted to him.This was another great read from Eve Vaughn.","07 21, 2011",A27R0OWR8BGLZ9,"SocialReader ""Voracious Reader""",1311206400

However, the first thing I noticed was the lack of editing. Many paragraphs had two people talking in them so that you were constantly going back and forth between characters, and trying to make sense of it. The second thing was the hero was a jerk. He treated the heroine like crap. All he wanted was to have sex with her, even when he believed she was his brother's girlfriend. And then he did. What kind of brother does that? A big no no for me is also when the hero sleeps with other women,(implied) even if he and the heroine were on a break. Granted, they were on a break for 6 months but if he cared anything about the girl he wouldn't be jumping into someone else's bed.What irritated me about the heroine is she hates him one minute, and sleeps with him the next. She's wishy washy and her character is weak. You didn't get the feel that there was any real warmth, even real lust developing between them. The sex scenes were luke warm but it was more because of the author's choice of words than the actual act.And yet somehow they fall in love and she finally gets that proposal at the end. Which just ended. I kept hitting the page thinking that there had to be more.","01 22, 2013",A1TOIAXAJ2KB4R,Tory Richards,1358812800

3105,B004C44556,"[50, 59]",5,"Bait to buy?This ""book/short"" is really just a full blown ad for his other book.Chapter one starts 10% into the ""book"" - after 10% of reviews for Beyond Justice.  Then this ""tale"" goes to the 49% mark.  With the last 50% dedicated to an excerpt os BJ.  Well, after a brief word from the ""sponser"" (author).The meager 39% dedicated to the ""hero"" is a TELL - nothing shown.  Though with the length I suppose there was no alternative for the writer.When I got this a while ago, it was not listed in Christian.  The one sentence description says ""redemption"" - but in a mystery /thriller (which this is listed under genre wise) that could hold meaning other than someone finding God.  It is not uncommon for teasers and word play - rather than literal intrepretation in such genre.  So, I was not expecting such a Christian heavy work.  That said, it was fine once I realized the case.  However, that is precicely what ruined the book as it became predictably obvious after the first Bible verse.  It is unfortunate as mysteries /thriller's should have some - well - mystery OR thrill.  None of either found here.But, the thing most frustrating is that this work was really just an offering to push another (more pricey) book.  While authors often push other works in some other novel - they do NOT devote 60% to that other book.There are a few punctuation errors and a couple word use issues - but was well edited.I won't try another from this author as I can buy a magazine if I want to read ads.Christine","05 13, 2012",A30YDY4XKVUBUY,Christine Staeven,1336867200
2620,B002Z13UO0,"[0, 0]",5,"I thought this book started out fairly well.About half way through there came one plot element/device that pretty much occupied the rest of the story.That's okay, but not great.  It left me with the feeling that not too much happened.The world seemed a bit thin and there were few compelling allusions to anything greater and deeper churning within the as-yet-untold-story behind the story.I waffled a bit between a 3 & a 4 rating, but I did enjoy the read, so I opted for the 4.As other commenters mentioned, there's a lot of hiccups to the writing due to incorrect grammar and occasionally the narrative will shift very temporarily to first person and jolt the reader out of the story.There's also that horrible horrible war between 'effect' and 'affect' that is rampant within this book.  These words are commonly misused within the book, which obviously irritated other reviewers more than it did me, yet I was not completely immune.What bothered me more was the lack of characterization and rationale for the actions of certain characters.  Some characters seemed stupid-angry simply because it was the only way to advance the plot in the direction the author wanted.Obviously I liked the book in certain ways.  I liked the main character.  I liked the process in which he began making a place for himself in his world.  I liked the relationships he had with several of his peers (and I liked several of those peers).  I liked the general description of the world.  I even liked the beginning of the main conflict, and a bit of the middle of the main conflict (though it seemed to drag on at some points).The question is how much promise does this author and this series have?  Will I pay $2.99 for the second book in the series?Right now I'm leaning against it.But if my current stash of $0.99 fiction runs dry, it will be in the realm of possibility.","07 1, 2011",A259Q7R79WRGOY,"Brian Chrisman ""fooburger""",1309478400

Rebecca sitting down on a ""white"" couch, every article of clothing described by color, every outfit change detailed.

Now, granted, I've never been to Germany, but I do have friends who live in Germany and there is not a single one of them who would be caught dead going swimming in a lake in February.  I think the author may have lost track of the time in the book because she also described the sky as being the ""spring"" sky, and February is not generally called spring, here or there.I'm chalking this book up to being another sappy, sad, average WWII story with some bad editing.

I was looking forward to this book mainly because I usually love Maya Banks's style. But I found myself having to push through parts of the story. The plot sounded good, different, and it was. However, there was no real angst. The story, by design, starts out in the middle of the relationship. She does explain what led up to this point, however, the men never show their &#34;alpha-ness&#34; in any true sense and she just capitulates to them way to easily. None of them seem to have any friends or family as well. If she was so unhappy and lonely, why didn't she talk to them? Why is it only the three of them? The only other character mentioned is the men's personal assistant who seems to be on her side. But she doesn't confide in her either. Also, it is mentioned in the very beginning that one of the characters may not be happy with the arrangement and that line is quickly dropped, never to be mentioned again. I normally would highly recommend anything by this author but I don't feel I can with this one.

3843,B002ASASR0,"[6, 6]",5,"I read this because someone recommended it to me, and it was a cute read.  Other reviewers have already summed up the book, so I won't go into that.  I'd say the author's biggest strength is her humor.  I'll give an example.  The hero had the heroine in a bath (she wasn't feeling well at the time so he was trying to bring down her fever), and she asked, ""What am I doing here and why do I keep touching your lovely chest?"" It was the last part that had me laughing out loud.  Even as I think of it now, I'm laughing.This is a good book for people who like women disguised as men stories where the women are strong and fully capable of taking care of themselves.  The heroine was no wimpering female, and the hero was lovable too.One thing I don't understand is why this was tagged as a Christian romance.  If you're familiar with the traditional market for Christian romances, this is not tame enough to be termed Christian.  There's stuff in here that would be deemed offensive.  Though the hero and heroine never went all the way, they did go pretty far, and since Christian romances don't go beyond the kiss and some readers thinking necking is ""lustful"", I don't know if I'd recommend this book to women who are uncomfortable with nudity and touching body parts that are usually covered.  (For me, this is not a problem, but since I've seen some reviews by women who expected a very clean Christian romance and got upset with ""necking"", they won't like this book.  But if you like a little more realism in your book, then I say go for it!)Like I said, I have no problems with this book.

I was nervous about purchasing the book based on the idea that it was 3 short stories. It's not that price was an issue - the author set a very low price which more than compensated for the length of the book. I was just a little leery because of the basic limitation in shorter works. In a short story, the author has very little time & space to set up the characters. In a fantasy setting, where the author has to set up a world for the characters and then set up the characters, short fiction is even harder and it takes a lot of talent for an author to overcome this. I thought Ms. Schneider did a great job. The world-building was a little sketchy but the characters and the story content more than compensated.My only complaint is that I'd really like to see more stories, or better yet a novel, set in this world.

I have found that Mr. Sides is an excellent story teller. The characters become better defined with each book.

Even better, spell check.  There were obvious typos that running spell check would have caught.  There were parts of the book inserted into other parts that made no sense. For example, when the main character was on the bridge, talking to the captain, there's suddenly a dialogue of several paragraphs long with a female character, when the two men were the only ones in the map room.  For another, the characters were hard to tell apart.  They're introduced by name, dropped in with little to no description, and none of them stood out for me. I can't even remember the names and I just finished reading less than an hour ago.I scrapbook. I take my family photos and put them on a page with elements and journaling that tell the story of what happened on that particular occasion.  I don't always scrapbook all the photos from a given day at the same time. I might return to it months later.  The first time I had my finished product printed, I discovered that I often told the same story page after page, because I didn't create them at the same time.  I've learned, before printing, to check for duplication, flow and continuity. This book didn't have that.  We were told the same things over and over, often a few paragraphs apart.  We were told thing in dialogue rather than shown them in description.I didn't ""feel"" like I was there. I didn't care for the characters. I didn't feel anything other than boredom while reading this book","04 22, 2013",A1WCKURV6GMXGP,Reader With Standards,1366588800

That doesn't stop her from being extremely attracted to two of her bosses, Jon and JT.  She's heard the rumors about them sharing women and is trying very hard to convince herself that she isn't interested in the two of them - together.Jon and JT have no qualms about their lifestyle or the fact that they want to make Christina a part of it.  The problem is that she's so skittish that getting close to her has been impossible - until now.  They've enlisted the aid of her friend Aislinn to help make Christina more comfortable with them.Aislinn is aware of Christina's aversion to men and alcohol but she also knows Jon and JT well enough to know that neither man would hurt her and judging by Christina's relaxed demeanor when the men are around she knows it too.  Since Christina isn't about to trust any man enough to start a romantic relationship, Aislinn suggests she indulge in a fling - just to get them out of her system.Christina follows her instincts and allows herself to be seduced into Jon and JT's bed for a sexual encounter she'll never forget.  Hours later she's awaken by the ringing of her cell phone only to receive the devastating news that her mother has died.  Christina's positive her father's abuse is what killed her mother.  Neither man will allow her to contend with her family alone.  Christina is going to have to come to grips with her feelings for them and learn to trust them - with her heart and her well-being.  She just may learn that there are some men who are not a complete waste of skin!Annmarie McKenna's THE STRENGTH OF THREE is more than a smoldering romance, it's a glimpse into the lives of children brought up in abusive homes as adults.  I really have to admire Christina for not only having the strength to stand up to her father and brother but for being brave enough to give Jon and JT a chance.  She's obviously afraid of history repeating itself but figures a fling with Jon and JT is safe enough.  Jon and JT are wonderfully alpha male and so intent on winning Christina's trust that it makes you smile just reading about them.  As for Christina's father and brother, well you'll love to hate them and the situation that led to Christina's mother's death.  Plus I have to tell you I got a real kick out of JT and Jon kidnapping Christina's guard dog to bring it to their home so she'd feel safer with them.  I can just see this huge dog going for these ex-military's gonads, too funny.If you're curious about Aislinn's story and haven't done so yet, be sure to pick up a copy of TWO SIGHTED.

There is no other way to describe it.Ariel is kidnapped by an alien race that is living on a meteorite. When its determined that she cant breed with the race they use her as the prize in a fight between other races of slaves. Ral, a Zorn, wins her. So what does the hero do???? He takes her straight to his room and forces her to have sex with him. REAL ROMANTIC. Within a few days Ral and a couple of other Zorn conveniently highjack a ship and escape. By this point Ariel is in love with Ral. But when they get back to his planet everyone hates her and is against her. And again she is a wall flower and does whatever he says. Oh but lets not forget that they can no longer communicate with one another because the devices the other alien race put on them that allowed them to understand one another have been removed. The topping on the crap cake is when Ariel is almost raped by three Zorn men. The reason behind this is just awesome...... Ariel and Ral were recorded getting it on at the medical center... it was recorded and put on their form of internet. The Zorn men saw how hot it was and decided they wanted it too.Im sure the author was aiming at erotica but it fell short... really short. There is no character development. The author tried to put WAY to many things into a story of this length.  The ""love"" Ariel feels for Ral is more like Stockholm syndrome.* I do not base my review on price.

11496,B004477ZLW,"[7, 10]",5,"I have read many books with in this genre. They seem to fall into two categories. Either they are well written, well thought out love stories that just happen to have more than one partner in the mix. (Note: Maya Bank's Colters' series.) Or the stories are like this book: The Perfect Union. Too quick with the declaration of love. Too quick agreeing to a relationship like the men were proposing, and too quick with the sex. Even the acceptance from friends and family seemed to be automatic, as if this type of relationship happened every day.It is obvious to me that the writer wanted to get the three together so that their sexual attraction can be written. I am a writer as well, so I believe I understand the motivation. She probably had a series of ideas she wanted to accomplish with the book. But I believe she rushed through them, as if doing so off of a check list. Situations have to be worked through carefully and slowly if they are to be believable.Finding love, especially after the death of someone that meant a lot to a person, isn't easy. Sure, there are those times when the sparks fly, but the widow or widower often feels squeamish about having another relationship. Add children to the mix and, I'm sorry, they don't have sex on the kitchen floor when their children are due home any minute. A mother will do what she can to shield her children and reassure them that they are what is most important to her.The way Rick and Conor are accepted by the children is believable, don't get me wrong. They were in the boys' lives since they were infants. The children never knew their father so having them around was normal to them. But I am only half way through the book, and no where did Calleigh wonder what their father would think bringing someone else (or two someones) into their lives as a father figure.I don't understand Calleigh's spouting of their relationship to strangers either. And the storyline about the coworker who thought he was her boyfriend was so unbelievable, especially since he wasn't mentioned since the only date they had months before.As I said, I have only read half of this book. I haven't gotten to the part where Kevin's parents show up, but I'm sure it will be as the rest of the book is. Contrite and off of the same checklist.The prose is choppy. The conversations are more than choppy. I don't feel that this story is anything more than a poor version of what can be found on one of the erotic story sites. I'm sure that Ms. Lane had good intentions, but I feel that this story could have been so much more if it didn't seem as though it was rushed, and if it had more feelings in it. I guess what I am trying to say is that this story 'tells' us what is happening. We don't 'feel' it. Just because it is written down, doesn't mean that it is so. The reader has to feel the events unfold before she can believe that they are happening.I gave it one star instead of none because the sex scenes were believable, not contrived positions that only the author would see. I felt no passion between the three lovers, no angst, no real love and affection. All I have seen so far is sex.Yes, the sex is good. I will give it that. But please... Nothing else is believable.","08 6, 2011",A3FGWM78573GZU,Just Terri,1312588800

But little did she know that instead of the happy reaction she expected, he became incensed, called her a liar and threw her out on the street in the middle of the night. 3 years later, Alessandro is back, but for business reasons - Scarlett has become a skilful interior decorator which he wishes to engage to refurbish his new property. In her close proximity with Alessandro, should she push for a relationship between Alessandro and his son? or just leave it be as if Alessandro realised the truth, he might take her son away from her forever...The gift of this author is that she makes the male leads more reasonable and their actions more understandable. The reasons for Alessandro's rejection of Scarlett's pregnancy proclaimation is, while harsh, yet understandable when you realise the reasons behind it. (As opposed to other male leads in other books which makes you feel like smacking them for being such arrogant pigs and you can't understand the double standards or irrationality of it all.)Perhaps I'm spoilt by her other books (One Last Night (Harlequin Presents), but i felt that this book was alright.

Jo is hurt and angry that she was lead to believe Paul was dead.  Paul wants to begin again, but first he has to convince Jo to both forgive him and to understand.  Love brought them together and drove them apart. Now when the danger to Jo seems to follow her, will love be enough to give Paul and Jo another chance?Still Mine has several of my favorite aspects in a story: hot sexy scenes, engaging main characters, and enough suspense that it makes you want to read quickly to find out the ending.  Jo has grown up and found a career even while loving the husband she believes is dead.  Paul made a decision he thought would save Jo from danger and was given a second chance.  From the moment they met face-to-face, I was drawn in and could not flip the pages fast enough.  Even before giving in to their passion, I could feel the strength of it.  I was quickly reminded that the emotions that give passion can produce equal fear and anger.  Watching Jo and Paul try and work out the past to hopefully lead to a new future for them showed me that a true and deep love never really dies.  When the danger comes from an unexpected angle, at least for me, I loved seeing the depth of the trust that had been restored between Paul and Jo.

All of his characters are exagerated stereotypes and the interpersonal exchanges would have resulted in few of these protagonists ever reaching command because of the obvious psycholoogical abberations present.One sure indicator of his unfamiliarity with naval (spaceship or surfaceship) life is his lubberly use of &#34;the&#34; before ship names.  We who have spent many years and many deck watches know that a manned ship is truly a living entity, christened at its birth (launching), and possessing the nature and personality of its officers and crew.  Use of &#34;the&#34; before its given name is akin to referring to this book's author as &#34;the David Derrico.&#34;Also, as Isaac Azimov pointed out repeatedly, good science fiction must be good science.

How do I count this. If you read it using Kindle it is easy especially when the first sex scene stops at 33% of the book. So while the sex is well written it is just too much. And why does a guy has to finally top or bottom, when he is reluctant initially, just to prove he is finally ready to take the plunge in a gay relationship.

His job is one of undercover danger and quite often, the only thing he can depend on besides himself is the calm voice at the other end of his link.  A voice that only has a name but not a face.  That is about to end as he and the rest of the group have been called into meeting in New York City.  Tony knows that Charlotte is efficient and calm in all circumstances; he also knows that she can be ruthless and guesses that she is a matronly lady.Charlotte Rhames is the executive assistant to the Devlin Group, a job she loves and is respected at.  She knows most people take her for only how she appears: rich and beautiful.  Charlotte can't wait to meet Tony. She knows everything about him, but has never actually met the man.  Charlotte has many expectations for their meeting, which she is hoping, ends in her home.Tony is stunned when he actually discovers the person behind the voice is the young and sexy woman who came to pick him up.  This shock is just the beginning of the events that will put the entire Devlin Group on high alert.  When the group is attacked, they discover it was an inside job.  Charlotte knows she is the only one who can get to the person behind the attack, but it will mean going back into a world she swore never to visit again.  Tony won't let Charlotte go into danger alone, but when things go horribly wrong, both of them have to depend on the voices and abilities of the people on the other end of the links.On the Edge brings back the characters from the Devlin Group and this time is Charlotte's turn to get her happy ever after.  But when you are a member of this group, nothing is ever easy and that includes love.  Tony has been put down most of his life because of his background - the same one that makes him perfect in his undercover work.  Charlotte has worked hard over the years to remove herself from her past and now she must face it again to save the others.  Danger feeds passion, and Tony and Charlotte already had the flames rising even before the danger happened.  I was never happier than when Tony and Charlotte made it out okay only to have them tear each other apart.  It made me want to knock their heads together, but I was rewarded in the end with a perfect ending.  Suspense stories have always been able to hold me in their grip. Ms. Stacey did one even better and wouldn't let me put the book down until the last word had been read.  On the Edge is sexy, full of danger, and has two main characters I just had to back.

5821,B0042P5FMM,"[6, 8]",5,". NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 2 in the Wicked series that starts withWicked Sexy: Wicked, Book 1that is set in a world of witches (Magians) who mate into threesomes. A fun premise from a talented author, I'm excited to see where the series goes... but not thrilled so far. This book was a disappointment all around. If this was another author, perhaps a new author, I might give it 3 stars, but because it's Alexander I'm giving it 2 because we all know she can do better in her sleep. If you aren't familiar with her work yet- PLEASE don't start here! I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea! Maybe her Children of the Goddess series linked below.PLOT: There really wasn't any coherent plot- just a series of unfortunate events. The pacing was choppy. There was no build up of of tension- sexual or otherwise. Kidnapping is a tough angle to work into a romance. It takes skill to create an opportunity for a girl to forgive that kind of thing, but here there was no compelling reason for Harrison to do so. (Kresley Cole and Gena Showalter are two authors who excel at turning that kind of thing around.) I'm not even sure I understood what the hell happened during the resolution of the main conflict. Harrison's extreme need for independence was never properly embraced. It was as if this was merely a ploy to get the story started and then turned into a trivial event- perhaps even a childish one. I was really disappointed in that aspect.ROMANCE: There was no development along these lines either. Three attractive people... some hot, but quick sex... a few paragraphs of back story to give them each a little history... then BAM, all of a sudden happily ever after? No working together, no winning each other over, no endearing moments? Nope, not feeling it- which is a real shame because I usually love the threesome set up. This had potential over book 1 because unlike book 1, the men here were romantically involved with each other.CHARACTERS: What characters? Were there characters, because I might have missed that... Sarcasm aside, our girl Harrison had a lot of potential and I felt like the lack of plot stomped all over her. Jacob and Ric were little more than spoiled, arrogant underwear models with magic. Not even sure if either of them had jobs or hobbies.BOTTOM LINE: This wasn't offensive, but barely worth reading. There are still some fun moments here, but overall a disappointment. If you are a fan of Alexander, then I recommend just reading it because I STILL have faith this series will get better.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. R.G. Alexander's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series:Regina in the Sun (Children of the Goddess)2. Moira Rogers' magically diverse romance seriesCrux: Southern Arcana, Book 13. Anya Bast'sWitch Fire (Elemental Witches, Book 1)- sweet, sexy para-romance with witches, demons and more4. Dana Marie Bell'sDare to Believe (The Gray Court)- sexy para-romance with all manner of fae: Sidhe, dragons, leprechauns, vampires and more.5. Kresley Cole's adventurous  and intricate magical romance series (never mind the ridiculous title):A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)6. Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob (The Nightwalkers, Book 1)- demons, were, vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy7. Larissa Ione'sPleasure Unbound (Demonica, Book 1)- demon centric romance series that sets up a demon-run hospital under a human city. Not as well written as the others.8. Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters, vamps and Greek gods. The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.9. J.R. Ward'sDark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 1)- also darker, more violent and incredibly intense vampire romance series. Vampires protect the world from evil. Vivid glimpses into the evil perspective as well.10. Lara Adrian's Kiss of Midnight (The Midnight Breed, Book 1) - also darker, more violent, but incredibly intense. Vampires protect the world from their evil brethren.","03 26, 2011",AQNXEOJ4RPCGW,A. McKinnon,1301097600

I put ""story"" in quotes because, although it's that way in the title, this is actually a novel.The plot was original with a gritty, noir setting. The fantasy world of Markhat was enthralling. Mr. Tuttle really knows how to draw the reader into a different world by showing the way things are, instead of just telling about it.The storyline moved at a fairly fast pace. There were some twists and turns that left me gasping, once even bringing a few tears. Although the book is filled with Vampires and other odd creatures, it is still a very `human' story.Although this book is part of a series featuring the character of Markhat, like the others, it can be read as a stand-alone.Character Development: 5 StarsMarkhat was a wonderfully deep character with an interesting past that was revealed in bits and pieces throughout the story. He was always `in character' with believable motivations.Mama Hog was also present in this installment. I was happy to see her again as she is the perfect companion and mother-figure for Markhat.The new characters introduced in this book were also very well-drawn. Each had their own motives and personalities, making them likable or easy to hate, as needed.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle was in his usual fine form. There was humor interlaced through even the most gruesome portions. The humor was sometimes blatant and, at other times, a bit obscure, but always there if a reader cared to look, and I did.The descriptions were vivid. The dialogue was snappy and in good form. Everyone spoke with just the right amount of accent to be believable and have a unique voice. The sentence structure was complex, but flowed easily.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsBoth were of professional quality.Rating: PG-13 for Blood and Gore, Oblique References to Prostitution, Violence","02 28, 2010",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,1267315200

7920,B001NPDA44,"[9, 9]",5,"BELKIN NEOPRENE KINDLE 2 CASEI just purchased a Kindle 2 after my Kindle 1 died, perhaps partially because of the fact it slipped out of its Amazon case (poorly designed in my opinion) and fell a few times, hitting the floor or my desk fairly hard. The Amazon case also did not protect it completely when I was traveling and it was not in use. Since my wife already had a Kindle 2, I was aware that Amazon had provided metal hooks to secure that model in its case, and that the thinner design made it easier to read in the case as well. However, I wanted something to protect my Kindle to the maximum extent possible possible when I was traveling, especially on the train to and from work or when on a plane, rather than just slipping it into a pocket of my briefcase or computer bag and having it fall out by accident when they were open.After reading the reviews, I decided to buy this Belkin case despite my concern that the Kindle had to be removed from the case to read it and it did not fit in the case with the Amazon cover on it. However, I am DELIGHTED with this product. It is exactly what I expected after reading the description and reviews. The Kindle easily fits in it, and because it only zippers across the top and one side the Kindle will not slip out when you open it. Both front and back are well padded, so you don't have to worry how you insert your Kindle, the screen will be protected. and the Kindle 2 is so thin and the case so soft and flexible that it easily slips into a corner of my briefcase, there is no noticeable bulk at all. The only complaint I will echo is that the zippers could have been more heavy duty, although I have had no problems with them.I also bought the Amazon case, expecting to use it when I was reading the Kindle at home or uninterruptedly for a long period of time while traveling, but have found that the design of the Kindle 2 makes it very comfortable to simply read it without a case, especially since the back cover can not slip off as it frequently did with my Kindle 1.Finally, the neoprene smell of which some reviewers complained has been non-existent. either Belkin has modified the product in some manner or I have been very fortunate, but from the time I unwrapped it there has been no odor at at. And I am very sensitive to all strong smells, being severely allergic and sensitive to many odors and often sneezing uncontrollably when initially exposed to them.So, if you carry your Kindle when you travel and want to conveniently protect it when it is not in use whether on the road or at home, I highly recommend this case.If problems develop with this product or it is less durable than it appears, I will edit this review to indicate any problems which arise which would cause me to lower my five star rating.Tucker Andersen","12 12, 2009",AVGGEAI1YGSAP,Tucker Andersen,1260576000
11186,B002TSAORU,"[8, 9]",5,"This story started off well - lots of mystery, a strange character called Feathers (Feathers?) who is a resident in the block of flats where Izzy and her son go to live, the mysterious woods and spooky  writing on the wall. It soon went downhill for me. Izzy just never stops talking. It seems that everything that pops into her head has to be written out. Sometimes I felt as though I was an observer of a real life situation and being forced to listen to the banal, half-heard conversation of strangers.  She just jabbers on and you soon realize that nothing she says means much. It would probably work better if you had some idea of the emotions Izzy, and the other characters, were feeling. You never quite know. Izzy cries a lot, she gets drunk when any sensible person would figure they would need all their wits, she goes on crying jags, loses her temper, slams things around but you are never completely sure just why.  She vacillates between spunky and helpless within the space of five minutes. I found myself getting thoroughly irritated by her.I could not warm to any of the characters in this story. Izzy was annoying, her son was odd and seemed to mostly hover in the background and Feathers - well he just seemed like an aged hippy who may or may not be a little loopy.  He didn't get my heart beating.  He didn't do a whole lot for Izzy either. Their romance was luke-warm at best.Izzy is pretty stupid. She is told in so many different ways to keep away from the woods but for some reason, she refuses to believe.  Ok, the story needed her to go into the woods and it was a build up in suspense but why then, does she show healthy scepticism about the woods and yet on several occasions later in the story, when something really outstandingly weird happens, she just accepts it?  Despite the scary, scary wood and her idiocy in stirring up the creature in there, as soon as something bad happens her first thoughts were to blame someone else entirely and, to make it even more confusing, she was right.There are a few typos/spelling errors in this book. The spelling of 'neanderthal' was inspired - I am not sure if it was a case of reversing letters or if the author really thought it was spelt that way - and there were several instances of 'breath' instead of 'breathe'.All in all, it was not a waste of my 99c. The story skipped along and there were parts where I felt quite frightened. The magic in the story was unusual enough to be interesting.

However, once I stuck it out past the first 5 or 6 chapters, I was pleasantly surprised. I found that instead of the instant sex appeal and gripping tensions with characters that immediately immersed me in the past, it was a story that read like a slow burn, gradually building up layers of complexity, and personality in all the players involved.

Everything happens in one long sentence and at that point you have to go on to find out what happens next.The story is about an American who is forced to work for a Mexican gang who traffics drugs across the border with the United States. You see the character's ascent from common man, who must count on his expertise to make himself indispensable to his new ""boss"", thus avoiding his own death and that of her daughter, to expert trafficker and unscrupulous criminal.The rhythm is that an action story, but the suspense is typical of a thriller. While accompanying the character to his descent into hell, one wonders how he will ever get out of that situation, and from time to time our theories are proved wrong by the latest turn of events.The very title of ""Borderline Case"" has the double meaning of referring to a geographical border and to a borderline patient, emphasizing the dual reading of the story.Although told in third person, in fact, the novel follows almost exclusively the main character, Eric, except for some scenes, so you end up deeply understanding and sympathizing for him. The other characters are almost all portrayed in a rather superficial way, perhaps deliberately not to distract too much the reader from the main problem (the survival of Eric) and make sure they won't mind if they got killed. Which happens often.If it were a movie in theaters, I would say that the ticket costed very little, if the price is divided by the number of deaths. And this aspect, if we talk about drug trafficking and especially action, is undoubtedly positive.Really an excellent reading.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return","05 11, 2012",A3RMCZMUUTFXSB,"Anakina ""Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli""",1336694400

With a touch of magic and a bite of an apple, she hires the three women who share a design company to renovate an Old Victorian and turn it into a sexual retreat, with each friend taking a room to decorate according to their deepest fantasies. Lindsay Bell, the bawdy bad girl of the trio, is intent on a BDSM room that'll tickle her fancy. What she hadn't planned on was gorgeous handyman Brad Caldwell to help her. Soon all Lindsay can think of is trying out - with Brad - all the new toys for the room and getting Brad to take her where she's always wanted to go...the pledge to swear off men be damned.Unfortunately, I had some problems with this novella on just about every front. Beyond the set up of the concept for the plot, there just wasn't much attention given to plot or character development, and the relationship between Brad and Lindsay suffered as a result. Seeming perfunctory and shallow, neither lends to the sort of tone that would allow for a seductive BDSM scene...but that doesn't even really become an issue because the 'play' in this role play was exceedingly tame. Not that I would have wanted hard core, I didn't. But I just couldn't suspend my disbelief...and a bit of distaste...in part because the development of the characters and relationship were so sparse, and in part because I just didn't buy the idea that Lindsay would in just a few days time share with Brad a kink (a relatively harmless kink, really) that she'd never mentioned to any of her other boyfriends before. There are just too many problems with that all around.There was an attempt to add some depth to Brad's character, and much of that attempt succeeded. I liked his issues with wanting to go to med school and the problems he's had with women over his blue collar job. He and the not-quite-a-cat were my two favorite parts of this novella.

This novella is just that -- a short story.  It comes in  at 78 pages according to Amazon and I want to mention that it is even shorter than that since the last 10 percent maybe of the book is previews for other stories.This is a sexy and short M/F/M menage read.  The main couple is John Garrett and Shelby Harper with the third person involved is Carson Scott. After pining for each other for a year, Shelby finally invites John and Carson up to her place after closing time.  She had the cafe open during a heat wave for the service men and she over hears Carson and John talking about how vanilla Shelby probably is.  Shelby is convinced to show them how un-vanilla she is by acting out her fantasy of two men at one time.I really enjoyed this short story and the writer made it believable.  While Carson was more of a third wheel in the story, he was a pivotal player in getting these two together.  Even though it does feature instant love after one night together with a small glitch of insecurities, I could actually see these two people together for the long haul.While it was in no means a book that will be above others, I will say that this short story was a great start to being introduced to this author for the first time.  If this had been a full length novel, I am sure it would have rated higher in my opinion. New readers of this author will get a quick thrill with John and Shelby and will be wanting to follow it up with the next novella in the series.","03 10, 2013",A1U09Q4OP6XIK6,A. Jacobs,1362873600

She's always been halfway in love with Douglas, the Duke of Ethingham, so during a waltz she propositions him.  Douglas is stunned when Cicely asks him to seduce her and quickly refuses.  Although Cicely is disappointed she resolves to move on to the next gentleman on her list.  However, very much against his will, Douglas discovers that he can't allow Cicely to be in anyone's arms but his.  As they begin a sensuous journey, Douglas is stunned to find that every moment in Cicely's company makes him only want her more.  As they finally begin to realize that they are falling deeply in love, Cicely's life is threatened and Douglas will do whatever is necessary to protect her.  As the attacks continue can he find the person responsible before it's too late?Without a doubt Melissa Schroeder gets better with each and every book!  I love historical romance and admit to being a bit of a historical romance snob, so it takes a lot for me to truly become absorbed in a book in this genre.

It fills in some gaps in historical knowledge, as all historical novels do, with speculation.  This makes the story flow. And at the end we are not sure but that Montezuma's Treasure may have been left as this story suggests.The book combines this adventure with a modern-day search for that very Treasure. And this takes place in tandem. We get a little of the current story and then we switch to the historical one and follow that. Intertwined.  This can be disconcerting.  Just as you get involved in Mexican border wars we switch to conquistadors on horseback.  But I thought this just made the whole better.And add to the mix the frequent transcriptions of a Mexican talk-radio reports to move the action along.Clever literary devices that will can spark your interest.The author has managed to tell the story of La Malinche and the Spanish Conquest and to describe the potential of a Mexican government melt-down while providing a colorful description of the heritage of the Americas.A terrific read.","08 23, 2010",AVHACTPAGE53N,geoff thomas,1282521600

Their sexual chemistry remains just as strong and Caitlin is happy to bring Eamon home with her for a bit of naughtiness.  Surprised at the feelings Eamon makes her feel, Caitlin is unsure of taking their relationship further.  Neither Eamon nor Caitlin count on falling in love with each other.  When that happens, they have no earthly idea how to make their relationship work.A deer in the headlights.

While the books can stand on their own, the charm and appeal of the books (for me, at least) lie in the characters, who feel like friends with whom you don't want to lose touch.  I love a good mystery, which this book has in spades, with just the right dose of humor, fun and friendship thrown in for good measure.

4555,B002AVVGNW,"[0, 1]",5,"4 and 1/2 stars! A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney is captivating, somewhat sad, yet sweet in its ugly duckling theme. Louisa believes herself to be ugly, not just unattractive, but actually ugly. She hears the snickers when she enters a room, the horrible insults launched at her back as she passes by, and knows that no man truly wants her for anything more than her extensive dowry. When she encounters the dark stranger who lives in a cave, keeps to the shadows but whose soothing voice and demeanor intrigues, and attracts her, she soon learns that there is more to a person than what is reflected in the mirror, or in others' eyes. Douglas fears that trying to live in the world alongside those who are so different from him endangers all who cross his path. Soon he learns that whereas normal is a concept which all humans strive to obtain, no one is truly normal and he may be accepted for his differences more easily than he expects.This dark, sweet novella about love overcoming diversity and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder will keep you enthralled from the beginning moments, when Louisa discovers the cave home of Douglas to the reveal of his dark secret, a lovely dance in the moonlight, and their eventual happily-ever-after. I highly recommend reading A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney for any number of reasons listed above, but mostly because it's just that good - in fact, I wish it had been longer.***Copy gifted as part of subscribing to author's newsletter.

9658,B004BDP5G6,"[11, 14]",5,"I was not fond of the way the story was told. Like I was on the outside looking in. The reader gets told how each character feels. It got tedious for me. The first half of the story wasnt that bad, but somewhere around the 50% mark it started to get really bizzare.Plot: Basically this is a story about 2 people who are wildly attracted to each other each with their own hang ups. She has a fiance out of state whom she ""thinks she will grow to love in time."" He has a dead fiancee and a sister that dies mid story.  The title made me think I might get porn, while the cover art suggested romance so I gave it a try. The writing- with its God references peppered through out- made me think this might be an ""undercover"" Christian book. You know the kind where the author is out to prove that a story can be secular, but still clean enough for the prude reader? It wasnt.Characters: Trevor is a 25 year old fashion designer and he's not gay? Panzina is 21 with the life experience of a thirty year old. She has raised her fiances 4 year old son since birth- despite the fact that said fiance seems pretty absent. And when she gives up the son to the biological mother- there is no sadness or loss beyond one paragraph. And if the story is chronological- she doesnt see the son more than once in 6 months after giving him up.I know absolutely nothing about the author, but I am inclined to say that Patterson is quite a few decades past 21 and 25. Her characters have experiences and world views far beyond the typical 20 something. Also her 25 year old millionaire came from a very poor family- he made his fortune pretty fast and he's still pretty grounded. Normally- he would still be in the drugs, alcohol, and models stage if he was a real guy.Writing: there are times when I thought Patterson's first language wasnt english. There were several phrases that no young person would say, we arent raised to be stilted and formal. Ex) ""What do you have a taste for?""Her writing is flowery and over the top at times; ""It meant that he desired her company, craved it more than the delicious sushi, which he described."" Or ""She was such a passionate woman that incidents like this could permanently mark her heart."" Or ""his eyes appraised her figure with admiration."" Patterson tells us how her characters feel constantly using the most creative language she can find: ""She felt dreary as she walked up the front steps"" and ""her emotions churned in turmoil.""What I mean by bizzare: Panzina is engaged, yet she hardly thinks about Telvin. She has no problems holding hands, kissing and fondling Trevor, yet she plans on being a virgin on her wedding night. Yeah, Patterson over plays the pure, good girl thing. Then in a really weird twist, she gives herself as balm when Trevor's sister dies and her needs ""comfort"" saying, ""She forgot about her fears, reservations and promises made. Trevor had been there for her when she neeeded someone desperately. It was only right to be there for him in his time of need. She wouldnt be a virgin on her wedding night, but at least her first time would be with a man whom she truly loved.""Also- Patterson couldnt keep track of her own world. Trevor's ""penthouse"" has a driveway, patio, and full sized pool. Characters can walk up to the door. Forgive me, but I have always been taught that the penthouse is the top of a highrise or appartment building. And Trevor hates coffee yet he orders it. How do I know he hates coffee? Because Patterson has her characters have a several paragraph conversation about how he wont drink it because it tastes like dirt.But the icing on the cake of bizarre for me is when Panzina has the epiphany, ""Trevor might like me if I finally break off my engagement."" Yeah, she was a total ditz. I have zero respect for Panzina. She was the kind of woman that I ridicule on a regular basis.Would I recommend it: No, not unless you are super into drama and soap opera style characters are your thing.

Because of how Debra handled her attraction to Maddox before this, I didn't think she was yet at the stage where she'd give in to her, and his, lust. I would also have liked to see more story before the sex scene, which was long and fairly explicit.

Even though Harlan will no longer be his student, Sawyer is still hesitant to get involve with him because of his job at the strip club. He was not sure he can handle having his boyfriend lusted after night after night.  When Harlan's persistence wears down Sawyer's resistance will the two be able to sustain a relationship outside of the bedroom?You can Leave Your Hat On is a very hot and sexy story, with a great storyline, but unfortunately I wasn't very taken with the characters. Physically, Sawyer and Harlan were hot together, but outside of the bedroom, I didn't like Sawyer very much.  I found him to be very rude and domineering and I did not like how he treated Harlan.

I also found that the story opened up subplots that left me wondering the outcome, especially where Harlan's brother was concerned.

The author sticks to that concept in interesting ways.The sense of humor I have come to expect from Mr. Tuttle is present in each story making for a very fun read.I would have liked a little more background to better understand the vow taken by Wistril, how it was enforced, etc.Character Development: 4 StarsThere was a ""Forward"" included that introduced Wistril and his apprentice, Kern.

Kansas is a independent wealthy man who decided to live like an hermit in his family land. When he is swept away from a tornado, no one notices his absence, and so Kansas is free to enjoy is adventure.He awakes in a strange world, inhabited by half-man half-beast being; the first two he meets are a cat like man and a bird like woman, a strange couple indeed. When the two find this strange being with bare skin and blue eyes, they think that it would be a nice gift for their king and decide to bring Kansas to him, even if the cat-like man would like to have a taste. In this world sensuality is the normal behavior and sex is almost a recreational activity; Kansas will discover that even a simple bath in a pond has sexual consequences, and not thanks to another being, but since the waters are alive.When Kansas arrives to the king's palace, the first human-like man he meets is Z, a wizard. He is almost ""normal"" if not for the fact that he is extremely handsome and gold colored. Z. tells Kansas that, if he wants to have the chance to go back to home, he should refuse the king... and here maybe The Wizard of Oz mixed with One Thousand and One Nights. And here maybe is where I'd like the story to be a bit longer: there is an acceleration that brings the reader to the end of the story when it would be interesting to have more; the relationship between the King and Kansas is only hinted, and almost chaste in comparison to all the other sexual experiences Kansas had before ""consorting"" with the King.Naughty thought on the title: Not in Kansas means that the story is not setting in Kansas like The Wizard of Oz, or that the King is not allowed to ""enter"" Kansas (and I don't mean the State...)Anyway as I said the story is nice and enjoyable, more funny than serious; this is not the classical fantasy tale heavy in details, but it's more a funny escapade in a world that maybe is the dream world in Kansas' mind.","01 30, 2013",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,1359504000

The ranch's owner, Wade, was Simon's partner, and has never been able to recover after Simon's Death. What ensues is a tale of both men burying their grief, and discovering the ability to love again.The story is well-written. The characters are nuanced enough to differentiate them from each other. The emotions feel real, and many scenes are touching and moving. Wade starts out as a shattered man. Simon was a huge part of his life, and Simon's absence is everywhere he looks. Being no stranger to the loss of a partner, I couldn't help but be moved to tears at points. Maybe the words struck home more easily to me because, upon experiencing loss, there will always be tender areas in your heart where pain is easily felt. Or maybe it was the writer was gifted at evoking those emotions. Regardless, there was bittersweet pain within the pages.Dylan's grief was deeply examined too. In Dylan's case, Simon was his cherished brother who died in his arms after they crashed their car. He moved from the Lazy G ranch because he not only could not face the absence of his brother in all the places he should be, but because he felt he should be the one to die, not Simon. He believed Wade would eventually tell him the same, and he could not bear that moment. To add into Dylan's grief is the guilt he felt because he always had a crush on Wade.The writing is pleasant and with good imagery. The characters do have a uniqueness to them which could have been fleshed out a little better, but they were still well-written. Interestingly, Simon is the most interesting character, and he's only examined briefly in a few memories. The only drawback I could find is that the heartfelt ending felt inevitable. The road it took to get there was interesting, but there were few and insignificant obstacles along the way. Still, there were very touching, romantic, sensual, erotic, funny, and heartfelt moments.

Otherwise, you'll be saying ""huh?"" throughout the story.I judge my science fiction on a modified version of the Baen criteria: the scientific advances / future technology needs to be somewhat believable, if there are aliens they need to be presented in some realistic format with names I can pronounce in my head while I read, and must have some type of plot with circumstances - good or bad - with their resolution I can get my head around, believe, and be interested in turning to the next page to learn more; that's quite a mouthful, but we've all read a lot of bad science fiction over the years.With all that being said, this book hits it on most fronts - like Book One of the series I still can't pronounce the names of the alien races, but Book Two seems a bit rushed and incomplete to me.  There's not too much interaction with Daniel, and (without having a spoiler) I found a couple of the situations near the end a bit unrealistic.  The author did a great job setting the stage for ten years since the conclusion of Book One, then about two-thirds into the Kindle version it seemed as if there must have been a mad push to get this story told, completed, and out the door.  Many scenes could / should have been developed more as they were incomplete.I still enjoyed the series overall.

I posit too that people in imminent danger of being murdered are not likely to take time out for some nookie while they are still in an extremely vulnerable locale.  Nor are they likely to take even more time to make a phone call from that locale - a call that could easily and safely be completed via cell phone as they sped away to a safehouse.Wish I could figure out which kind of tales these are before buying - its not always obvious.","03 31, 2011",A2N2W83UVYWLE4,NC:theothergardenstate,1301529600

The story is essentially one of self-discovery by several characters while trying to defeat evil in the forms of a wicked witch and the various types of goblin.  The good guys defeat the goblins, but the goblin lord escapes to menace the future.  Other plot lines are left open, so additional novels in this vein are a possibility.

I was very happy to find out that it is not.The story is about a campground of mostly pre-teens, who end up being without any adult supervision after a fog, of unknown but deadly variety, cuts them off from most of the world.The only adult that was left at the campground was a 20 year old counselor, who seems to withdraw into herself and out of the issues that are coming up.A small group of kids end up taking charge of the group. And they do very well at it. The leader, nicknamed Chief, is Mike, a 13 year old teen. Nobody else seems to even have any ideas of what to do, other than himself and a few of their friends.This book takes place over a time period of about 3 years. Mike is 13 when it starts and is one week shy of 16 when it ends.I didn't have much of a problem with some of the age differences. One of the couples was a 17 year old teen and a early to mid 20's woman. I didn't find that at all unusual, or upsetting. I thought that the remarkable strength, of 20 year old man who is sexually targeted by a 14 year girl, was kind of neat.It does need some editing.

I'm not sure if they are from bad formatting or from author/editor error, so I won't fault the author on that.  However, I do fault the author for not being able to decide if he was writing for an adult audience or a YA audience.  I wish he had made up his mind.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but sometimes it felt childish and other times it seemed a bit 'too much'.  YA-lit is a tough thing to write.  It's always a fine line between being too watered down and being over the top.Also, everything seems 'too easy' and 'too convenient'.  Everything the kids need falls in their laps.  They want to build a better shelter - a guy from a logging camp shows up.  A girl is pregnant - they find a nurse.  It would be interesting to see how the kids had handled the birth of a baby with no medical help.  It would have also been nice to see the kids fail once in a while.  I know there were bad guys around and they killed people and caused problems, but I'm not talking about that kind of thing.  It would have been nice if one of the kids ideas had not worked.  ""Lets make this...Lets build that"" and every idea works out perfectly.  That's not realistic.  It's ok to fail at a task.  People learn from their mistakes and people can learn from reading other people's mistakes too.I'm all for supporting new authors, and I do give the guy credit for coming up with a good idea.  I just wish he had proof read a little better and did some re-writes to fix parts of the story that don't flow well.  Also, the first chapter could be dropped completely and it would make the story flow much better.

7633,B001BXN5HA,"[1, 1]",5,"Vengeance by A.J. Scudiere was one of two books I got from Scudiere's publisher for review.  I read Resonance first, and really enjoyed it.  I had saved Vengeance for last because it was written after Resonance and I didn't know if it was a follow-up with the same characters.  I quickly found out...  it's not.  It's *completely* different, and *really* good.  I had a harder time putting this one down than the first.  I'd have been perfectly happy had it gone even longer than its 400 pages.Lee Maxwell was an accountant with a nice happy family.  That is, until he discovered that he was working for a business run by the mafia.  His attempt to contact the authorities and leave his job only led to the gruesome death of his wife and daughter.  He went off the grid, buried his identity, and started working on getting revenge for the killings.  During one of his operations, he runs into another killer, ""Sin"", who is young, female, dressed in leather, and an expert in knives and slow, painful deaths.  It quickly becomes obvious that they have the same purpose in life...  revenge on the mafia and other assorted lowlifes who need to be stopped one way or another.  Owen Dunham, the FBI agent on the case, has to figure out who the ""Grudge Ninja"" is, and why ""he"" is killing all these people.  But should the truth be known, he'd rather allow the killings to continue, as it's a swift and deadly form of frontier justice.  Lee and Sin have to come to some sort of arrangement in order to stay out of each other's way and maximize their efforts.  Why should they both spend time researching the same target, only to find out the other one got there first for the kill?  But Sin has her own dark history that drives her revenge, and opening up to another person is not something she's able to do.  The revenge killings reach a crescendo as the FBI starts to get their first real evidence left behind at the scene.  The question becomes whether Lee and Sin will finish their list before the FBI (or the mafia) gets to them first...The story starts out from three very different perspectives, that of Sin, Lee, and Owen.  And it's not clear at first why Lee is gunning down scum, and why Sin is leaving dead bodies with multiple cuts and slices, complete with crime documentation, all wrapped up (literally) in a big red bow.  Dunham has his own issues, as he really wants to get out of the business and take time to enjoy his wife and daughter before she tires of his demanding job and leaves him.  But once Sin and Lee start to confront each other, the story and characters really start to jell.  Neither of them want to trust each other, but neither of them wants to eliminate the other, either.  This tentative truce gives way to the beginning of trust, all to seek vengeance against those who have destroyed their lives.  I was also quite satisfied with the ending, as I wasn't looking forward to how I *though* it was going to conclude.Very dark, plenty of action, and character interaction that was stellar...  An excellent read.","12 29, 2008",A3R19YKNL641X3,"Thomas Duff ""Duffbert""",1230508800

458,B002C04RZU,"[0, 0]",5,"London, 1840`Wicked' Wade Warrick doesn't deserve the rake reputation he has - he's simply being judged by his brothers' unruly behavior.  All he has to do is dance with a woman once and rumors begin flying fast and furious all over the ton.  No father would allow him within touching distance of a virginal daughter which is why it's stunning when he leaves a crowded ballroom only to find the engaged reigning beauty of the haute ton awaiting him in his carriage.Lady Helen Richmond, daughter of the Earl of Charbeau, is on a mission.  Her father has betrothed her to a man not of her choosing and refuses to listen to her objections to the match.  She's taking matters into her own hands and has decided to proposition `Wicked Warrick.'  She has no doubt that the arrogant Duke of Resdale will no longer want her if she's ruined and she's sincerely counting on Wade to come to the rescue in her time of need.Wade isn't one for indiscriminate sex and he certainly isn't comfortable deflowering a virgin.  He believes that one should feel something for a woman besides lust before taking her to his bed.  Helen's proposition is shocking - and oddly enough she isn't expecting marriage and in fact insists that she'd like to keep their association a secret.  Helen's put a lot of thought into her decision to approach Wade and the simple fact that he's never shown any interest in her is a huge plus.  If he'd been one of her many admirers then their `association' would result in being forced to marry and that holds no appeal to her.After much discussion, Wade realizes that he is attracted to Helen and saying no to her is practically impossible.  Helen is stunned that Wade requires so much convincing - after all wouldn't a rake be overjoyed at the idea of sex without any expectations?  Fortunately, Wade does agree to bed her and the experience is better than Helen ever dared to hope.Now that Helen's been `ruined' she's safe from the unwanted marriage but now she's craving more time with Wade.  She knows that there's no possibility of anything more permanent with Wade but there's nothing wrong with a few stolen moments - or hours, is there?  Wade's assured her that he's not a rake but surely a man so skilled in bed has been with more women than he's letting on.  Things get a little more complicated when she begins experiencing signs of pregnancy - and there's the attack on Wade.  Wade and Helen are sure that her ex-fianc&eacute; is behind the incident but can they prove it?Emma Wildes' historicals are always a pleasure to read.  The characters are strong and brilliantly depicted so that readers are quickly caught up in their plights.  CAN'T SAY NO is the third book in THE IMPROPER LADIES series and it's a fabulous addition to Ms. Wildes' booklist.  Helen's determination to be `ruined' and Wade's disbelief at her plea drew me into the storyline but it's the passion and desire between them that kept me enchanted by their story.  In addition there's plenty of mystery, laughter, joy and even a few tears that make CAN'T SAY NO a title you won't want to miss.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","10 1, 2012",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

Kelly and Jae knew each other better than they thought they did thanks to those emails, otherwise I would be saying the sex and &#34; love you's&#34; came too fast.

Yes, Will was abused but Kelly didn't know about it until after sex had pretty much stopped between them. Also, Will mentioned wanting someone to &#34;save&#34; him, and maybe Will saw Kelly as that person and found comfort and not resentment in the nature of the relationship.I would have liked to see more of Jae's family, just for te humor of all of the angry Asian women he talked about... would have lightened up the book some. It had its angst, but nothing I felt was overplayed. The feelings were organic.I did become slightly... fed up with the on-again off-agin part.

Then I ran into, what I consider to be, a fatal flaw. Mr. Rain did a drastic POV change. As with all his other books, this one started out in first person. Half way through the book he started sections of third person POV in order to follow Faye, the heroine/love interest. Further along he split again to Farid""s POV in order to show the fight between Farid and Kaseem. I'm sorry, but I just felt that this was poor writing practice. There is nothing wrong with changing POV as such, but going from first to third along with that---not good!I also had trouble suspending disbelief on some of the mountaineering in this book. I don't think Mr. Rain knows or cares about such realities as hypothermia. I also found the helicopter sequence unbelievable. A helicopter is much more complicated to fly than a fixed wing. Having the girl just hold the cyclic doesn't cut it.The character of Sam Ward seemed like a very watered down version of Jim Knighthorse. I didn't feel like Sam was his own character, so to speak.Hopefully, Mr. Rain will continue to write books about his Vampire Detective and Jim Knighthorse.

The entries are about the right length. And they are enjoyable to read. I am addicted to Engadget, so I pretty much see tech events as they happen in almost real time. Amazon's reporting on those events is only about 24 hours behind, or just barely behind.There's a couple of strange things that just don't work so well. The formatting is odd at best. There's a lot of hyperlinks in the blog. Unfortunately on a Kindle they get underlined with a little character behing them and some spaces - so it's super strange to read with these annoying little characters. Of course you can open up the hyperlink by clicking, but it's kind of a pain.Images don't always work the best. They are OK, but sometimes there's more pictures that are important.Then there's video posted occaisonally, well that sure doens't work at all.Now the biggest complaint.

I read a lot of books that I don't bother to review, but this one stands apart.I'm not sure if I'm getting pickier as time goes on, or if there are just fewer and fewer books that are able to keep my attention.  Whatever the reason, I've been having a *really* hard time finding books that I want to bother to start reading, and even fewer that I actually bother to finish.  ""The Realm Shift"" by James Somers was a rare treat in a sea of blah.The main character is a teenager, and Somers manages to write him in a believable, likeable way (which is really saying something considering the fact that the character boasts spectacular powers-- and could easily be a shallow character).  I actually cared about what was going to happen to him.I also enjoyed the plot.  Somers does a good job at pacing and keeping the story exciting.  There's nothing worse than being engaged in a story and then the author slows the action/story down to relate mundane details (ex. describing room decorations ad nauseum, or wasting pages giving the menu for dinner).  Somehow the author is able to have an economy of words.  Enough to give you a vivid picture of what's going on, but not so much that you get bored or want to skim.He also weaves a moral good story without being cheesy, trite, or heavy-handed.To me a book is worth it, not so much based on cost, if its worth the reading hours I invested. Everyone's limited reading time is precious, and authors should not waste that time (neither should readers). Let me assure you, this book is MORE than worth it on both counts (money spent and time invested).  I'm not sure exactly what brought me to James Somers page, but I am very glad I found it, and purchased this book (and am in the middle of thoroughly enjoying the sequel ""The Order of Shaddai"").I am planning to check out many more of James Somers books and advise any readers that stumble across this review to do the same.","01 14, 2010",A12L5NKQ4EHD90,M.L.,1263427200

What she doesn't know is that she is actually the alpha wolf, Taran's, mate. He has been keeping his feelings and his mating instinct a secret because he thinks she will reject him because they are family. When Lark becomes in danger after inadvertently becoming involved in one of Taran's police investigations he must protect her and his own heart.In this world, werewolf's are a known species so there was no big species shocker for Lark which made the storyline flow with ease. I really liked the characters in this story. Taran is still a gruff and bossy alpha wolf but he still has a sense of humor and you can understand why he kept his feelings from Lark. Lark is absolutely hilarious and she loves teasing Taran. She is also not afraid to go after what she wants when she puts her mind to it.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves shifters, romance and some red hot love scenes!

I thought the second book was much to heavy and the Chris and Eliza didn't have nearly as much fun as Kayla/Dylan and Missy/Brody did. I found myself laughing at loud at some of their antics and hot and bothered at most of the love scenes. As a plus-size woman I can truly understand her insecurities and though Brody was a handful I think he handled them fine. As someone who loves a domineering man I didn't have a problem with his heavy-handedness.This was a quick read for me and I will be revisiting this story again.

She is told by her father that he is arranging her marriage to two men--one a childhood friend and the other, and arrogant stranger--all in an attempt to unite two kingdoms with their Falcon Kingdom.  She can't believe he is doing that...Pierce is a prince of the Tiger Kingdom and Jason is a prince of the Lion Kingdom.  They have been a couple for quite a while and have decided that Delilah is just the person to make their triad.  It's just too bad she isn't willing to go along with the deal.On what should have been their wedding day, Delilah has changed the plans.  She has taken flight and now Pierce and Jason will have to track down and capture their mate.  Will this be a true bonding triad or will Delilah's instant dislike of the idea and her partners doom it before it begins?Theirs to Capture brings three very different shifters into mating.  At least two of them are happy about it, however, Delilah is determined to escape her fate.  I found the sexual encounters to be erotic and when they finally do join in a true mating it brought them together as a whole like the Pierce and Jason always wanted.  After reading the blurb and with the way the Delilah began, I expected more from her than weakly giving in.  It is obvious that her anger was just a way of showing shock at her future.  That being said, Theirs to Capture is an erotic story, perfect to while away an afternoon or evening.JoReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","01 22, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1264118400
3155,B001CN45MS,"[2, 2]",5,"This is actually a prequel to the Out of Uniform Series, I think it does not show as the first book because its just a bit shorter than the other books, and was probably a part of summer reads. This is a short novella. But I consider it the first book of the series.Shelby and Garrett have become friends during the past year but only because Garrett has ignored Shelby's overtures for more. Garrett is crazy for Shelby but thinks she is too proper to consider him as a partner...Shelby overhears Garrett's friend describe her as vanilla and immediately challenges the two of them to a menage...I thought the book omitted a lot of opportunity to develop the characters but you only have so much time in roughly 1500 lines. Jumping from flirting to a menage was a bit of a stretch and I have to suspend reality to think for one moment that it wouldn't break up a good friendship - but this is fiction so go with it.If you are looking for exciting SEAL action like Suzanne Brockmann - forget it. This is not that kind of book. If you're reading for pure entertainment and you don't mind a lot of sex, this is for you. The SEALs are all good friends and buddies but you don't see much military action at all. If you read more of the books you will hear more about the characters from previous books.The storyline is good, the story is good but don't make it more than what it is. I've read the following books and have enjoyed them because they are quick and funny. Yes, I will read more Elle Kennedy books.","06 19, 2011",A1JXLTQ5VWPGGV,"chb-book addict ""book addict""",1308441600

I just feel like she gave in too too easily whenever they had situations where the hero had to explain or when the heroine had to explain.But onto the book info... Written in third person, no BDSM intimacy, adult book of course and not alot of spelling errors but I do feel like the writer needs to know where to start a whole new setting when a new paragraph kind pd starts somewhere else. I felt like she also need to fix the dialogues spoken because when the characters speak about one topic or so it'll be written in one whole paragraph and then when a new conversation starts, it's the sane thing all over again.Other than this, I would say that this was a great read and would recommend this book to most people. And the reason for saying only most people is that the other sum of people would probably have a favoring for a much stronger heroine rather than one who would give in too easily. I hope this helps.

Convincing her to leave her world and life to mate with them and relocate is a daunting task.  However, it's absolutely necessary because the Guardians have made it their personal goal to destroy all human females with Harmon blood and if the men don't take her with them now then she will die at the hands of one of the monsters.Being ripped from her home, career and life doesn't endear Caleb and Van to Anne.  Sure Valencia is beautiful and similar to Earth but it's not `home.'  There's no denying that Caleb and Van are gorgeous but no way can this all be a reality.  During the time she's in Valencia Caleb and Van become extremely important to Anne but can it really be love?  What about the Guardians threat to kill any woman able to mate with Harmon males?Anya Bast's TAKEN delivers on all those `out of this world' fantasies woman possess.  Anne's spunky attitude and refusal to blindly accept everything Caleb and Van tell her kept me chuckling - and kept her men guessing at what it would take to convince her to stay.  I was expecting a fun read when I selected this story but in no way did I anticipate the emotional impact it'd have.  Caleb, Van and Anne are a trio that truly capture the imagination and leave you salivating for more.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","08 6, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

Her fathers have decided to step down as Leos of the Pride and in doing so have made Jules' life a living Hell.  It is the tradition of her Pride to have two Leos and one Lioness in charge.  Much to Jules' dismay, when her fathers step down, every lion in the direct vicinity is sniffing after her trying to get her to mate, and she's tired of it.  Ready to run, Jules comes face to face with the two men who have no qualms about claiming their mate.Luke and Gabe Beckett knew three years ago that Jules was destined to be their mate and went to her fathers to cinch the deal.  Of course, Jules' fathers neglected to tell her that bit of information and when she finds out, she does exactly what they'd thought she'd do--she tries to run.  She doesn't get very far and when she's caught by Luke and Gabe, Jules is taken to their home and claimed.  The mating will come later once she accepts her position.  Time is not on their side, however, because Luke and Gabe aren't the only lions wanting Jules.  Now they must accept a mating challenge with the hope that they will be the victors.Claiming Their Mate was a great book!  I loved how Luke and Gabe could sense Jules' thoughts and feelings and did their best to make her comfortable in her new home.  Jules' temperament often seemed off to me--I wanted her to care for the brothers as much as I could tell they cared for her. But, despite that, I enjoyed the foray in the White Sands Pride of lions.  Claiming Their Mate was sensual and highly charged.  It was a well written m&eacute;nage that was almost innocent in its sensuality because of the lack of a certain sexual position shown in most m&eacute;nage stories.  The ending was sublime, although it seemed a bit cut off because I would have loved to have seen Luke, Jules, and Gabe at home in their own bed loving each other.

The heroine (for lack of a better word) is a paranoid, shallow mass of nothingness. We don't know if she could have had any more depth because the author provided absolutely no worthwhile character development. In fact, what little information the reader is given about her made her very unattractive. She is materialistic, narcissistic and moody for no clear reason. The very first page clumsily recalls how she picks a fight with her husband over absolutely nothing.Sadly, the pitiful introduction to her hair is the entire basis of the book, although the synopsis held so much promise. The husband is just there so the story can have a male counterpart; he is quite insignificant. If he mentions it once, he mentions it a thousand times that he wants to get to know his wife of seven years. What?!?3. Why does this author (for lack of a better word) make them have their only serious conversations right in the middle of the awful sex scenes, not once but several times? Weird. Other than that, there is no meaningful dialogue between the two of them.4. Some of the informational points are repeated, over and over, and over again. Why?5. If this is an IR romance, why was race in regards to their relationship never highlighted?6. Did I mention there is no plot?So, yes, this was an awful read and I now know to avoid this author.

She's been watching Jericho and Hunter, two men who live in an isolated cabin, and they have been watching her. When she is hurt, she allows them to help her--and they discover that their wild cougar companion is in fact a beautiful woman. They both form an attachment to her, and are reluctant to leave her even when their work calls them away.I liked that the plot was slow and mellow. It has a quiet, isolated feel that I found relaxing. It isn't an adventure story, and the paranormal element is uncomplicated and matter-of-fact. That simplicity really fit the story and set the tone.While reading this story, I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how the author intended to characterize each of her protagonists. Kaya comes across as a bit weak and helpless, but then you have to bare in mind that she hasn't had much human contact. Still, I feel like the author could have spent a little time establishing that Kaya does have some innate strength, and isn't totally dependent on her men to provide for her. Hunter is portrayed as the more closed off, emotionally isolated of the two men. Why that is is never fully explained. I can't really get a handle on Jericho's personality at all, other than that he's a bit more open than Hunter. Both men are, of course, insanely protective and intent on caring for Kaya. I think part of the problem at work here is page limitation. It's a short book, so there is only a limited amount of time to establish everyone's personality and allow them to develop.My other ""complaint"" is the sunny, slightly sugar coated ending. Everyone is accepting of Kaya and her relationship with two men. Nobody comments or thinks it's odd. Everybody is just part of a big happy family. That's a bit unrealistic. But then, this book has shape-shifting so I guess I shouldn't demand realism.All told, for a novella you can read in one day, this is worthwhile.

Adam is young and was thrown out of home for being gay.  He doesn't disclose that to Rhone.  For whatever reason, and highly unlikely as it may be, Rhone invites Adam to work for him and his brother in their security/PI business.  Hmm, suspended disbelief needed.  Adam accepts and starts work for them.  There is little detail around him starting the job and finding a place to live quite frankly, that could have been fleshed out to give some detail rather than a helicopter view of things. So then we move on to Rhone taking Adam home to live with him temporarily because apparently he was living in a roach motel and Rhone didn't want to have to identify his body when it all went pear shaped in the place.  The living arrangement turns into years.  Adam matures, Rhone dates women and brings them home to love them up.  Adam listens to this through the walls and then pleasures himself thinking of Rhone and Rhone never has a clue.  They work together, they live together, they spend time together and are firmly attached.  The firm grows and Adam is taken in as a partner.  After a double date where Rhone brings his one home Adam moves out because he needs step back from the non-relationship.  It is really annoying that Rhone is so clueless and Adam is so devoted but makes no move.I have read this a couple of times and feel the writing is lacking.

And for a man who cannot make a move on the love of his life how can we end up with him over the desk with his female colleague servicing him with toys?  I do not get that at all.

That being said...the author states at the beginning of the book that he thanks those who helped with re-writes and someone named Chene for editing. Editing? Hmmm. Need to get a new editor. Had that claim not been there, I would have given more slack. For instance, the use of 'to conger' when it should have been 'to conjure' or 'dear hunt' for 'deer hunt' and many more. As for other readers complaining about the female characters being portrayed as weak, etc...well...that is the author's right to describe his characters the way he wants. And those that had complaints about the hill people and their language-it's not an unheard of way of portraying people who have survived disasters. An episode of Star Trek (the original series) had characters butchering the language, and believe it or not, there are hill people alive today that speak in a very similar way, so no complaints there.The switching back and forth between the future and the past or rather present (however you wish to term it) is not hard to follow and actually had me curious as to how it would be resolved.If the author cleans the typos up, and fixes the incorrect tense of some verbs, and cleans up the pronouns I can easily see it as a 4-5 star book, but for now, it's two stars. Note to other writers: don't get in a hurry to throw your hard work out there. Take time to make it right and then present it.","10 21, 2012",A3J6E5PNMZNAJ1,readalot,1350777600

7064,B001XURN06,"[17, 19]",5,"Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic ""The Forsyte Saga,"" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.  Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to ""own"" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than ""property.""The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English ""Age of Innocence."" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (""Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl"") and lushly written descriptives (""... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago"").As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to ""own"" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the ""Forsye Saga,"" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels.","03 25, 2010",A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,"E.

The author apparently doesn't have the faintest idea what commas are for, because they are used when they shouldn't be and are unfortunately lacking where they should be.  Lack of commas results in run-on sentences that defy translation.  Errors like &#34;could of&#34; instead of &#34;could've&#34; or &#34;could have&#34; are frequent, and the writing style is amateurish and annoying.I would like to excuse all this by the fact that the author was born in Europe and so came to English as a second language.  But the biography indicates that a lot of writing has been done since then, so one would assume that a better grasp of the English language would have taken place at some time.  My husband came to this country at the age of 40 with six languages in his grasp, and, although he is not an author, his writing (when he does it) is absolutely correct.  Hmm.

I get that sequels are for people who have read the first book, but a little backstory never hurt anyone. There is *none* in this book, and given that it's free, I think there should have been an expectation that this would be peoples' introduction to the series.So, anyway, Holly is eight months pregnant, and 'married' to three brothers who won't have sex with her because they're afraid of hurting her, or the baby.Eventually she manages to convince (i.e. corner and threaten with 'the wrath of a hormonal woman') two of the brothers, and have sex with them. Only one of these sex scenes appear in the book, the other fades to black.Eventually, she has the baby and everyone ends up happily ever after. The description of the birth is a little...graphic for my taste. I would much rather have read about that second sex scene than listen to one of the brothers try to make sure Holly had passed the placenta *shudder*What's really irritating, is the extract at the end of this book is intriguing, but because of the lack of characterisation, backstory and world-building (I know it's not fantasy, but there is zero description of Holly's location and surroundings), means I won't read that book.I only finished this book because it was mercifully short, and I would have felt very guilty giving up on a short story.","04 9, 2012",A1OK2B6G8FNYFM,CharlotteSimmons,1333929600

Running from her ex has her moving from place to place after several months but for the first time she is unable to remain detached from the people around her.  To complicate matters even further, she's falling for her boss and has witnessed his death in a clairvoyant vision.Ex-Special Forces operative and owner of Turner Industries, Kyle Turner III, knows everything there is to know about Aislinn.  He's had her carefully investigated and he's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex. She's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he'd desperately like to get to know her on more `intimate' terms.  An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.Kyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.  Kyle's positive he can protect her  . . .  all he has to do is prove it to her.  Simple right?  Well, maybe not quite as simple as you'd think.Annmarie McKenna's TWO SIGHTED will delight readers with the fun array of characters, witty conversations, sexual innuendos, and enough suspense to keep you riveted to the pages.  I loved the intensity of the relationship between Kyle and Aislinn.  And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle's `groupies' as she refers to them, Jon and JT, playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them.

Pooter, a senior bank clerk in the City renting a home in a London suburb of Holloway, encapsulates Victorian respectability, snobbery, and pretensions. Pooter nearly invariably gets the short end of the stick in his interactions with his two neighbors, Cummings and Gowings; his spendthrift, reckless son Lupin; and the various tradesmen and servants he attempts to bully. Slavishly devoted to his employer, Mr. Perkupp, Pooter tries without much luck to cut his son into the same mold. Instead, Lupin slacks at work and spends his nights engaged in amateur theatrics or carousing with his chums till all hours. What's a father to do?First serialized in Punch in 1888 and 1889, The Diary of a Nobody was published in book form in 1892 and hasn't been out of print since. If you give this slim volume a chance (available for free in the Kindle format), you'll see why. Despite being a century old, The Diary of a Nobody remains quite amusing and is laugh-out-loud funny in parts -- particularly in sections dealing with tradesmen or with Lupin's impetuous business dealings or love affairs.

His father, being the leader, is the Alpha wolf, and Vadim is the second in command, the Beta, the protector of his father and the pack. One night, in his den, a terrified small young man bursts into the room, slamming the doors behind him, looking to hide from some unseen pursuers. Vadim looks at him, his heart starts racing, he gets sexually aroused, his face flushes with heat, and he realizes he's looking at his mate.That's the thing about werewolves. While everyone has a soulmate, werewolves recognize their mate as soon as they're nearby. A werewolf feels an intense physical, emotional, and mental attraction and yearning, often being overcome and mesmerized by their mate, the second they lay eyes on them. The young man, an Omega werewolf named Sasha, looks at Vadim, and recognizes him as his mate.Protecting his mate from the pursuers, Vadim shelters Sasha. It turns out the pursuers return with their Alpha (and Sasha's Alpha too), and when they attack Sasha, Vadim kills them in a protective rage. Since he's defeated the Alpha, he is now the Alpha for that pack, and it's his responsibility to go to them and lead them. The pack lives on Vourdala island, a nice-sized isolated island off the coast and inhabited solely by werewolves or human friends/companions/family members of werewolves.The problem is that the prior beta of that pack terrorized them. Vadim must now undo the damage caused by their old Alpha, fight against a few relatives left behind who want to see Vadim out of the picture, and get the pack to realize that omegas are no longer scapegoats and pack prostitutes, but important members of the pack almost on par with the Alpha himself. Omegas are the peacekeepers and ambassadors. They're the backbone of the pack. Vadim must get rid of the old prejudices so that Sasha can flourish.The story is interesting and fun and very sexy. Characters are nicely developed. Action and suspense scenes are on the light side, often being resolved so quickly that the reader doesn't get a chance to feel a real sense of danger. Ms. Glenn sort of does ""action lite"". The focus is on the sexy and romantic stories being told, and the characters. And she's made fun and lovable characters. If you enjoy werewolves and sexy sentimental romantic encounters, this story is for you.

Two men who grew up together, one gay, the other straight have to marry/bond for their clans to strike a peace. You see the guys aren't just guys they are werewolves. So, we have two great cliches in one story: 1.) forced arranged marriage and 2.) paranormal/werewolves.However, while the story has some hot chemistry between the two leads, Hayden and Josh, the overall drama is told in flashbacks, which take away from the present day tale. Plus, Samhain nor the author don't warn for the out-of-the-blue rape that occurs to one of the heroes by some off-screen criminals (which did nothing to advance the plot), and seemed pointless. So I can only give the book 3 stars. The premise had promise, but did not come to full frution.","03 27, 2010",A11F5KW6QXHL8L,Lasha,1269648000

I have read none of them, so I don't know what her writing is like now, but this particular series started off nicely.This short story makes me think of Brighid's Choice.  I read it before it became a young adult release so I do not know if it is still the same, but the version I read was in my opinion the best book Ms. Cast has written.  I sobbed in reading that book and actually broke down and emailed Ms. Cast, so moved was I.  I never write authors.  She responded quickly with  her personal thoughts and emotions on the book and I remember thinking &#34;Wow!  I can't believe she took the time to writw this to me.  That is so nice of her.&#34;  I was impressed.So, while I do not know if the series is still the same, I enjoyed the ones I read and I do love the way she has this tying into not just the first one, but the series as a whole.  On the downside, it does seem quickly written and it is crazy short.  Too short for the price really.  While it does add an interesting twist to the beginning of the first book for those who have already read it, it's not necessary to enjoy the series.  In fact if the series is going to keep getting repackaged it should just be placed in the beginning if her first book of the series.I miss the way she wrote these and the first handfull of the Goddess Summoning series.  I would special order them at the time because it was the only way I could get them.  I read the sample of the last goddess book, but it read so unlike the others that I didn't download it.I give this three stars mostly because it's so short that you're not getting your money's worth. The basis of idea gets 5 stars.  The series itself gets a 4 1/2 star, but you'll want to make sure you read the two books &#34;Brighids Choice&#34; and something like &#34;Elphames Way&#34; though that last one could be wrong as I can't go check the title without losing what I've written since on my Kindle.  Though not listed here as part of the series for some reason, they are a very important and moving part.  I'll check and see if I can add them to the list.","10 4, 2011",A2WSG306MDVO0W,AG,1317686400

When she finds out that her father has given his permission and signed a marriage contract between she and Rafe, Emma is hurt and angry.  She knows that deep down a man life Rafe could never love a woman like her so she sets out to negotiate her own marriage terms.Rafe Sinclair can't believe his grandfather put a stipulation to his inheritance.  If he doesn't marry by his birthday, the ranch on which he lives will no longer be his.  Having no choice but to find a wife, Rafe doesn't look forward to the politics that go along with wife hunting.  However, his problem is solved when Emma Radcliff's father and he agree on his marrying Emma.  Now if he can just get Emma to agree, his inheritance will be safe and Rafe will have a wife.Emma and Rafe have to learn to be a team.  Each is cantankerous in their own way, Emma more so in my opinion than Rafe.  She was so angry at times that even I winced at her displeasure.  I thought Rafe was loyal and hero worthy.

Upon finishing this book, I didn't feel the need to read the other books in the serious, there aren't really loose ends left after this book ends, so that is nice if you're just looking for a holiday read, and not a new series.The premise of the book is that Noelle moves back to her hometown, and tries to get a job at the local bar, Raising Cain.

He says jobless Noelle can't work at the bar, so Noelle takes a job as a bell ringer - right outside the bar.  Sparks fly back and forth between Noelle and Cash, and a battle of wills takes place before we get to the HEA.Comparing this book to the descriptions of the other books in the Raising Cain series, I think this book must be tamer.

Her parents divorced due to her mother's inability to handle her father's depraved needs.  The apple doesn't fall far from the tree however.  Tess is a woman wanting and needing to be dominated.Ever since Cole Andrews cornered her at a party and let her know explicitly what he wanted to do to her, she hasn't been able to get him out of her mind.  She is well aware of the rumors of his sexual escapades and dominance.  But she's afraid of both him and herself.  Is she truly her father's daughter?Tess promised to spend the week at her father's estate for an upcoming party.  However, after arriving and settling in she learns her father and step-mother are out of town.  Cole has arranged to spend the week alone with Tess.  She can no longer hide and avoid him.  But, she won't give into him so easily.  She taunts him before heading up to her room for the night.  Tess awakens to find herself bound in her bed with a very naked Cole sitting next to her.Cole has let Tess run long enough.  His patience has worn out.  He is going to make her face her desires and accept what she needs.  He's warned her.  She is well aware of what he wants from her.  What he needs from her.Surrender is book 1 in the Bound Hearts series.  It's a very short read, but if anyone is familiar with Lora Leigh you know it's a hot one.  Tess loves Cole, but fears she'll just be another body in the bed to him.  With that in mind she dives in and faces her deepest desires.  Putting her trust in Cole, Tess finds the strength within herself to accept what she wants and what Cole has to offer.  These two are hot together.  I wish the story was longer, but it was a great introduction to the series.","10 13, 2012",A2KSFF4LKIS8JF,"My Secret Romance Book Reviews ""My Secret Rom...",1350086400

I like the narrator's voice, but considering this book was written in a four person POV, the narrator didn't even bother trying to differentiate the voices. I ended up rewinding a few times to see who was talking since it featured Zach & Angelo and Matt & Jared. My enjoyment of this series really plummeted with this book.This book started with Zach giving Angelo a free pass to be with another man, with the agreement that Angelo come home to him afterwards. Considering how hard they fought to be together 4 months ago, I was surprised that Angelo would quickly jump at the opportunities.The main problem that I had was that Angelo throws a conniption fit if someone looks sideways at Zach. It just seems hypocritical, and I was unsure of Zach's true motivations for allowing the free pass. If I really got why, I might have been able to accept it more.I completely with Jonathan's assessment that it would appear that they had an open relationship, but it only works one way. I mean, Angelo is getting a handjob on a public dancefloor in front of Zach, but Angelo attacks Jonathan for kissing Zach. Can you say hypocrite?I don't think Jonathan owed Angelo an apology, maybe an explanation but Angelo didn't even have the decency to offer  Jonathan an apology and explanation back. Angelo was just a taker and Zach a doormat in this book, and I didn't like it at all.Jared and Matt have been together for a little over a year, but Matt talked about how going all the way felt wrong. I am confused. In the prior books it seemed like they couldn't get enough, but Matt explains they do &#34;other stuff&#34;. I want to know if Matt is really gay because his feeling of guilt or that it doesn't &#34;feel right&#34; should concern Jared.I just don't get these relationships. I know everyone has what works for them, but right now, neither couple's interactions are working for me.

In the second book in the series (Omen)we are introduced to a new Sith culture, one that has been accidentally seperated from the rest of the galaxy for the last 5000 years.  This is very different from the ""There can only be Two"" Sith culture, which makes sense since they missed the whole rise of Darth Bane, the Sith Lord that founded the rule of two.This short story, The Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice, is the back story on how the Sith ended up on the planet Kesh.  Set 5000 years before time of The Fate of the Jedi we are introduced to a galaxy full of Sith.  If you plan of reading TFOTJ: Omen, this will give you insight into some of the most interesting and complex villians to inhabit the Star Wars expanded universe in some time.  I am guessing there will be several short books in this series, each timed to gather interest in the Fate of the Jedi stories.  Far from being just a publicity vehicle I found the story intriging and engaging.  It adds to the legend of some of the baddest guys in the galaxy, the Sith.

I did not enjoy it. To close to rape for my liking.Unlike the first book Ral&#8217;s Woman where Ral shows a genuine affection and protective concern for his human, Argernon dose not show these qualities for Casey until much much later in the book. Argernon is entirely shellfish and demands that Casey stay; because he can&#8217;t live without her. He gives her no choice. The same seduction techniques that Argernon uses are just like her ex who was trying to forcer her, and she should have told Argernon and he should have backed off and gotten to know her without the bondage.

Around 30% into the book we get some action outside the bedroom which was a change, but other then that it&#8217;s all about Argernon not letting Casey go.If you like to read a series in order then I recommend this book, but in general if your into overbearing alien men who don&#8217;t have a clue about women&#8217;s rights and like to use sex as a weapon to get what they want then you&#8217;ll like this, otherwise I would not recommend this one.","03 28, 2014",A3ANLUEKJBC1IZ,"Angela @ Angel's Guilty Pleasures ""Angel's Gu...",1395964800

By the end, I was gritting my teeth and forcing myself to finish because of an attachment to the characters and their plight. That's the good news.Many other reviewers have commented upon the same thing that drove me batty: Missing words, sometimes entire phrases or partial paragraphs, caused frequent reading stumbles. The problem grew worse the further I read, until by the end, every page -- and sometimes every paragraph on every page -- resembled Swiss cheese.Normally, I excuse minor formatting errors in ebooks. Mistakes happen. Often, the publisher (or the author, if the book is self-published) discovers the problem and issues a corrected version as soon as possible. More than two years after its release, the desperately flawed Kindle version remains unfixed, and the glitches are anything but minor. Why? To me, such an oversight indicates, at best, a lack of attention to the market; at worst a callous disrespect for readers.I enjoy Alexis Harrington's work, but my disappointment with the completely fixable flaws in the Kindle edition was so severe I do not foresee investing in her future ebook endeavors.","02 16, 2013",A2PHUP1WN3IZPC,Disorderly Words,1360972800

I loved the world Moira Rogers's created and I couldn't help wanting more and more of it!The modern world and society are hell on werewolf traditions and the packs living in big cities have been corrupted into something more akin to a dictatorship.Red Rock is home of one of the few packs in the world where the old laws and traditions are still appreciated and is also considered sanctuary to those who need to escape the cruel life among the distorted packs.In Sanctuary's Price we get to se the love story between the werewolf Dylan and the witch Sasha. A Romeo & Juliet sort of story, since werewolves and witches have been at war for centuries and the prejudice against each other runs quite deep.I love me some Alpha males, that is no secret, but what I really loved about this story was that Dylan wasn't really an Alpha male, he is more on the fringe of the pack's dynamic and even considered a weaker wolf. It was great to see that just because he isn't an Alpha, is doesn't mean he isn't strong and able to defend those he love and care about.Sasha is terrified, all the time, ever since her mentor was killed and she has had to hide amongst the werewolves, most of which hate her for being a witch. Just like Dylan, I loved seeing her prove to be much more than what people's perception of her.Dylan and Sasha are so perfect for each other and it's impossible not to pull for them from page one. I also love that even though the romance was definitely at the forefront of the novel, there was so much more going on plot wise, that you couldn't help but getting engaged in the action and the stakes in play.Ever since I read Moira Rogers's South Arcana series I've been a fan, The Red Rock Pass series just cements my love for this great duo of authors. Rogers is an automatic buy for me now!

Nate is a human lie detector but this special talent was never used.  Joe is a werewolf and they live in a werewolf community but Joe only shifted twice.  The sex scenes were not sensual; mostly, grab the lube and get to it.  There is more to gay sex than anal sex, but the author seems to forget it.  I also found it very irritating that Joe referred to Nate constantly as ""little man,"" ""little mate,"" and ""baby.""  Most often, he treated Nate as a child.  I don't like it when a woman is treated like a child by the Alpha male and it was really annoying here.  Alpha males can be protective, domineering and strong without treating the partner like a child.I'll probably read the next book in the series to see if the writing gets any better.","03 6, 2010",A2R30MMKZS8WMF,Susan Hokanson,1267833600

I can't begin to tell you how many things bugged me about this story. Besides the atrocious spelling and grammar, the plot and characters were just plain silly. Kat went from being obnoxious (which obviously translated to strength) to being a victim (which somehow translated to softness and a resilient spirit). The dialogue was terrible. Leafy boy? Buster?Seriously does anyone talk like that?There is also the glaring fact that a 21st century woman kept excusing absolutely heinous actions by her new warm and fuzzy slave-trading, child-murdering, woman-raping family because they didn't make her sleep with the other livestock (read: people).As far as I'm concerned, coercing her into having sex before he told her that she wouldn't be allowed to keep her child was just another example of what a great guy Leif was. At every opportunity to believe in her, her ""husband"" failed but in Kat's mind that was all right because, apparently when you've got piercing blue eyes and a six-pack, you can squeeze your wife's face so hard she cries and it's taken as a sign of what a passionate, conflicted, deep man you are. Am I the only one who wondered what happened to the plotline of Kat being erased from existence if her ancestor was killed? Leif was such a strong leader that he quaked in his buckskin boots every time he thought his warriors might think he wasn't tough? And where, oh where, did the ancient Norse get potatoes??

Chase, but well, sometime it's good to forget that there are places in this world where you can't really be who you are without worrying of the consequences, and it's important to tell the story as you would like it to be, since maybe, time over time, you will change a mind at time.And so in this story we have Tyler and J.T., twin rodeo cowboys. Both handsome and gay (well actually, J.T. is bisexual...), J.T. is the shiny twin, while Tyler is the shy one. Tyler is also the responsible one, first his mother on her death bed and then his father asked him to take care of his twin, and Tyler always acted as guardian angel. He also left his beloved ranch, and his beloved neighbor Ren, to follow his twin on the rodeo circuit. But eight years after, Tyler is wondering if it's not time to come back at home, J.T. or not J.T. on tow.At home there is not only is aging father, but also Ren, the older and handsome neighbor who was Tyler's unrequited first love. Tyler has never had the courage to confess to Ren his feelings, instead he talked to J.T. who, soon after, seduced Ren. Now Tyler doesn't know if being happy to have a proof that Ren is gay, or be unhappy to be forced once again to compete with his twin.On the other hand, Ren is only waiting for Tyler to be old enough, and tired enough of the outside world, to be ready to settle down in their ranches. Ren is the older brother of three, but his two brothers have no intention to stay at the ranch. So Ren is ready and willing to build a family, and Tyler was always is first choice when arriving to a life partner. His relationship with J.T. was only a fling, and something that tired him soon after the first encounter.Ren has some personality issues, a legacy from his military service during war time, and he needs to be in control in every moment. On the other hand, Tyler needs to let the control sometime, since he is always the reliable twin, the one who everyone expected to take the right decision. In this way, Ren and Tyler are perfect together, being Ren always the top in their relationship, and Tyler the willing bottom.So no problem in their relationship and no problem also outside their relationship: Tyler's father behaves like a old fashioned father, means that he only asks Ren's intentions toward his son, and he is more than happy when he is assured that they are honest; Ren's brothers are only waiting for their brother to find a partner in order to be able to move out of the ranch without worrying to leave their brother alone... Sure, there is no the time, or the chance, to see the behavior of who is not a strict relative, other than one of Tyler's friend, but the atmosphere of all the book is of a total acceptance of Ren and Tyler's love.Setting and details are very accurate, with few right positioned words, T.A. Chase gives the reader all the necessary details to be deeply immerse in the rodeo and breeding horse culture.","05 27, 2013",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,1369612800

Problem was that one of his student was an unstable teen who probably would need a psychiatric help and instead his family didn't take with the right seriousness the problem. Riley, the student, approached Lucas and when the man refused him, all went to hell: Lucas was raped and left for dead in a burning cabin. He managed to survive and to denounce Riley, but he also lost his life and his lover, who couldn't suffer his scarred body.Now Lucas has a new life in a little small town where everyone loves him, above all the local sheriff; Nicholas is an handsome man, with plenty of choice if he wants, but he sets his eyes on Lucas. When they met five years before, Lucas was still too traumatized by his past events and he was not ready for something serious, and so Nicholas accepted the second choice to be his best friend. But now Riley is out of prison and both Lucas than Nicholas know that the man will come for Lucas, and Nicholas is not willing to let the man take the most important thing he has, Lucas; since Nicholas has no doubt that Lucas is his own.The story is not very long and there is not mystery, since it's clear since the beginning that Riley will try to harm Lucas once again. It's more interesting to read and see how Nicholas will convince Lucas to accept not only his help but also his love. Truth be told, I think that Nicholas takes advantage of the situation to force Lucas to accept something than in other condition it will be years before they arrive to the same point. Probably Nicholas is tired to wait (but not enough to renounce) and above all he is tired to be judge by someone else actions. And this is maybe the point that I understood less: it's true that Lucas is scarred, but only on his back; in his everyday life, with dress on, he is a very beautiful man, and no one can notice his scars. All right, being a gay man, maybe having is back all scarred is a bit more important than a straight man (naughty Elisa, I know), but is it enough of a reason to dump someone? Lucas is clever, handsome, with a good work, is it possible that someone dumped him for some scars? And even if it happened, is it possible that he chose 10 years of chastity upon the action of only one man?Anyway, the story is quite tender and the sex is good, something I noticed in the previous books by the same author: she mixes well the two elements, never letting the sex take the main role in the story, always letting the tenderness and love being in first line.","02 10, 2009",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,1234224000

When Darius searches for his brother to share the news, he can not be found, it is then Darius realizes who the 'us' is.  To escape the pain and embarrassment, Darius moves to New Zealand and fulfills his business dreams.  Now almost ten years later he is the proud owner of a fabulous vacation resort but, his personal dreams are still locked on Liz and his brother's heartless betrayal.Liz has had her share of heartache, and much regret over making the biggest mistake of her life.  But, there is a current issue that takes precedence over her past.  Someone close to her is in desperate need, and Darius is the only one who can help.  When she finds him, on his far-off, exotic island, she realizes Darius is no longer the dependable, high-school sweetheart she jilted, his demeanor is cold and he is burning with revenge.  In spite of his feelings, Darius agrees to help her but, he demands something in return; the honeymoon they never had.  But, Darius' revengeful demand and past heartaches are put on hold when he discovers the secret Liz has been hiding all these years.HIS PERFECT MATCH is a familiar story, but it is told with plausible candor, and with a storyline reminiscent of fine wine. The story is of a love that needed to be aged, so it could evolve into something rich, warm and wonderful.

2261,B001IWL1ZM,"[4, 6]",5,"This is a short story.  I started reading about 9 and was done well before 12.  Tht being said, it didn't seem ridiculousy rushed as some short books do.  There was lots of male-dominated animalistic sex, some development of feelings, and even a little danger and death mixed into the &#34;plot.&#34;  It is a short story, so the plot is minimal and there is little character development.  Honestly, everything outside of the main characters getting it on seems more like an afterthought.  The one thing that really bothered me is the ending, though.  After the guy & girl get together, they go back and eveal that the bad guys' plot has been uncovered and thwarted, but it doesn't say how.  It seems to me it would have been cleaner to leave the resolution at the disposal of the green guy, or if it's a plot-continuation part for the next book, at the corporate guys in the ship.  The news report just seems hasty to me.Spoiler Alert:  A Tyger navigator is the only one who can safely program the Nav computer to get the ship through a dangerous asteroid belt, but because of unforseen delays our hero is cought onboard during his mating shift without a woman.  A female Tyger with a secret crush on the hero offers herself as his sex-slave, basically, while he is in shift so that he doesn't go crazy and so he can nav the ship.  Predictably, she falls for him even though she knows she shouldn't.  He falls for  but doesn't really get it.  Meanwhile, there's a terrorist plot to blow up the nav computer onboard and thus crash the ship into the asteroids.  The terrorist plants his bio bomb, which kills the nav computer.  He then tries to escape thru the arboretum where the lovers were holed up.  He sees the chick naked and tries to run past while Tyger tracks him down.  Tyer catches him and rips his throat out after questioning him briefly.  Tyger decides to manually steer the ship to the planet- a feat which hasn't been done in the last 100 years or more, and becomes a hero when he's successful.  Unfortunately, he offers to set the girl up as his mistress.  She takes off and he sulks for weeks.  Then his parents make him realize he should marry her even though she isn't from the upper class.  He runs off to get her to find she is on a ship and has just gone into heat.  He goes to her, and you can guess the rest- he asks her to promise to obey, and she asks him to cherish her.  Oh, then there was some little scene where we see the brains behind the terrorists being upset that it didn't work, and we learn that it's not about Ecoterrorism at all (which was hinted earlier), but rather about eliminating the competition of another shipping co.  In the very end, there is a news announcement that the plot was uncovered, but no details as to how or by whom.Overall, a decent read for a fee novella, but I might have been less kind had I paid for this book.  The submissive stuff was not over the top, fortunately, but isn't my thing so it detracted from my enjoyment some.","06 21, 2011",A15EL7I42ETNQX,Rain Levity,1308614400

It made for a good attention grabber.  Now while I don't mind that feeling when it comes to a plot line in general, I'm not so keen on it when it comes to the romance side of the plot so I read this one with mixed feelings in the beginning.  Glad I gave it a chance.  It still wouldn't be my favorite romance plot, but it turned out to be a fun story.Dev drives out to a predetermined meeting place to meet the alpha of the pack in the area he plans on relocating too.  Just as he arrives, he witness the alpha and his betas punish the pack omega.  They are holding him down getting ready for a rape and Dev rescues the smaller man.When Dev gets the guy away, he discovers that the handsome man is his mate.  Laine and Dev accept the circumstances quickly.  Laine fills in the situation of what is going on with the bully alpha to Dev and Dev realizes that he will have to take the guy on if he wants to stay in the area.Dev is part-owner in a construction company and his friends and part-owner join him.  The alpha steps up his aggression towards Laine forcing Dev's hand.  But even though that Laine is rather a klutz, he wants to help Dev take on the alpha and his betas.It is a novella length story so the plot jumps in and gets going quickly.  The shifter world described here includes the idea that when the wolves find their mate, there is a bond made.  Sometimes I don't mind this, but it happened before I had a chance to really get to know the characters so I wasn't sold on this relationship until late in the story.  These two went at it hot and heavy before they barely got past learning each other's first names.  Now don't get me wrong, I learned to like both characters once I got to know them and I liked them together.  Laine's klutziness and his sweet temperament were cute and Dev's patience and gentleness with Laine was nice.  It was not hard picturing Dev as a pack alpha just because of the two sides to his personality.  He liked to be in charge, but he was also very protective.  And that reminds me of another thing about this particular shifter world, I liked the idea of the different designations for those involved in the pack.  We are all familiar with alphas, and get the idea of betas who are the alpha's lieutenants, but I thought the inclusion of the lesser used omega or peacemaking wolf role was pretty cool.It was a light quick read that I can recommend to those who enjoy PNR that is more on the passionate side and isn't very dark.","11 9, 2012",A3MT311233OHMQ,"Sophia Rose ""Guest Reviewer for Delighted Rea...",1352419200

However, I could really see this as a possible future...easily.The novel started off with some very interesting opening chapters. The author did a terrific job of setting the stage for the story. A few portions, such as the marital advice from Emily's mother, almost had me laughing out loud.Unfortunately, once the stage was set, the story just didn't live up to its promise. It just kind of limped along, struggling to make too many points. There were some interesting segments, with plenty of humor thrown in, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the exceptionally weak plot and storyline.The plot was spread out over too many side stories to maintain my interest. The saving grace of this book was the humor and the setting.Character Development: 3 1/2 StarsLewis and Emily were adequately developed, if a little simplistic.

The spacecraft needs him to pilot so they ask for a volunteer.  A female Tyger from his planet volunteers.So they have sex, domineering sex that gets old after the first two times. He treats her like convenience.  She resents him but wants him. And could the character please stop saying the word pussy. The pun was old after the first 10 times.  The guy gets well enough to pilot, his heat ends, he dumps her, she is broken-hearted.He ends up missing her after all and decides to take her back.  She says yes. The end.Really.  No plot.No depth of character.The male character is unlikable.So that's what I have to say.  This one is a not worth the three dollars.If you like these types of books, read Lora Leigh's Mercury's War, Megan's Mark, Dawn's Reckoning.  Those three are much better than this one.  Want something with more humor?  Read  'When He Was Bad' or 'The Beast In Him' or any of the series by Shelly Laurenston.You want something with more edge?  Read about the Sazi series by C.T. Adams.But don't read this.","06 30, 2011",A1WTLJWU7F21FU,"B. Lou ""B.Lou""",1309392000

Oh and to make things worse she has also found her mate.  But he isn't a puma, he is a wolf, and she needs to be able to stand as his alpha.  This will be hard to do with a rod in her leg and a pin in her hip, she was hit by a car after all.When she finally gets to travel to live with her mate, Rick, she finds that there is another power hungry woman (Gina) who wants not only her man but her position in the pack.  Will she be able to finish the mating with Rick in time to have others let her heal?  Or is Gina beyond reason?  If Gina is beyond reason what will the outcome be to both Rick and Belle?The Halle Puma Series just keeps getting better and better.  In this installment we get to see just what happens when a puma and a wolf are mated, and the chaos that will result.  I think Steel Beauty is the perfect title for Belle and Rick's story.  I am not sure I have laughed this long and hard about the antics of a character in a long time.  When you get to the scene in the restaurant with Belle and Gina you will know what I mean.

7582,B002XOTPYI,"[0, 0]",5,"I have never read a book like this before. I am very conservative but thought I would check it out to try something new. I was very surprised at how much I did like it. I read some reviews where people were bashing the book because they were appalled about the threesome issue. It clearly stated in the description of the book that that was what this was. I knew what to expect and so should they if they bothered to read the description. It was very well written and the characters were people that seemed like real people you would want to be friends with. I really liked the fact that the men were geeks in high school and now were good looking and still wanted the girl they did in high school. Most of us were geeks in high school and would love to find out that someone they knew and may have liked as well had also liked them.The story was way too short though. It had so much potential and it just all of a sudden ended. I thought there was more to the book and kept scrolling through the after advertisement pages trying to find the rest of the story. ***Plot spoiler-don't read if you haven't read it*** when the men asked her to move in with them I thought that would be room for so much more story. I figured that it would continue with them living together and the struggles that they faced with being a threesome couple. The author raised that issue when they went to the parade. The characters discussed the issue briefly but nothing more came of it as the book suddenly ended. I thought for sure that the author would continue with the story showing how they struggled with their threesome relationship with their families and with the public. I thought even there might be some jealousy going to happen since they suggested she choose one of them to marry and the other one would ""understand"" since it wasn't legally possible to marry both. The author could have done so much with that. The struggle in her decision to choose which one to legally marry and the one who wasn't chosen struggling to accept her choice. Overall, I liked the book but I was so dissappointed that the author chose to end it where they did and didn't go any deeper into their relationship and develop where their relationship would go once they were really back to living in the real world from day to day.","01 15, 2011",AY7Y4VG8KQKYY,Susan K.

7871,B0038KX8S0,"[2, 4]",5,"The premise and basic plot for this book is not incredibly unique or creative.  Billionaire older brother kidnaps the wrong sister when he tries to save his playboy younger brother from making a big ""mistake.""  If you've ever read any Harlequin books, this premise will be very familiar.  However, whereas Harlequin books are edited and the plot generally follows in a concise manner, this book was unedited and all over the place in terms of character development, plot development, and writing style.I won't reiterate what many of the other posters stated regarding the incorrect and ubiquitous use of the word ""had.""  It starts in Chapter One and continues until the end.  Having been forewarned, I didn't try to make sense of it when I first came across it.  Because, when you first see the incorrect use of ""had"" you wonder if the character is having a flashback or something.  Then you realize, no, we are not going back in time; the author just didn't take any writing classes.  I ended up not even reading the ""had"" and automatically changing the sentence structure in my mind as I read it.So why is this a Harlequin book gone bad?  Because so much of the plot and characters just reeks of the typical Harlequin plot, but without the Harlequin delivery.  So much so, that it makes me wonder if this author was an avid Harlequin reader who one day decided to try her own hand at writing.  And I say this because I've read so many books that I've thought maybe I can write one too.  Only to realize that there is big difference between editing/critiquing/reviewing, and actually authoring a book.  As the other posters stated, an editor would have done this book a great deal of service.  Aside from the ""had"" issue, a good editor could have pointed out that the plot does not flow naturally, that the characters are just not developed enough (either make them very basic cookie cutter characters, or really flush them out), and just the general movement of the plot is entirely unbelieveable.Example: After kidnapping Diona, Nikias spends time with her going snorkeling and showing her around his island, etc., etc.  Now, if he was really the ruthless b**#$%&d; that the author tries to convey him as, then he would have completely ignored her while he continued with his own playboy ways.  I also find it unbelieveable that this brilliant self-made shipping tycoon didn't do the basic investigation necessary to know that Daryle had an older sister who was a nurse.  If you're going to spy on little brother, then do it properly.I'm glad the book was free, otherwise I would have felt ripped off. In fact, I still feel that the author should be paying the reviewers for the free editing critiques that we offer.","08 20, 2012",A77DYZSK06F2M,Picky User,1345420800

Melders are the rare result of a mutation that in Meli's case permits her to operate an energy ribbon through a bracelet on her wrist, severing anything in its path. For years, Meli's covertly filled the role of family assassin, killing whoever threatens the Galdes' survival. But Meli's tired of killing, and following her latest target, Meli's promised retirement will begin. That is until Celino Cervanna, the ruthless leader of the Cervanna family, ensured their financial ruin. Celino, a man Meli once knew intimately, and who is responsible for her voluntary excise from the rest of the Galdes. Knowing what she knows, infiltrating his life will be easy, but will she be able to strike when the moment arrives?This science fiction novella by Ilona Andrews - first published in 2009 - is the first book this year that I've wanted to kick myself for not reading sooner. I had the best intentions of doing so, but I used its shorter format as a justification for the delay. (""It's just a short story."") Which, no, it's actually a novella, an important difference. Not smart guys, not smart. Have I not read every Kate Daniels and Edge novel by Ilona Andrews and been entertained by their uncanny knack for incredible worldbuilding Every. Single. Time? And they did it again, and it was even a meaner feat because Silent Blade is not a full-length novel. After wasting away for months on my Kindle, I finally opened it standing in line for Bitterblue at BEA this year, and the wait time flew by.Did I mention that I couldn't put Silent Blade down? Later at the MoMA, I cut into my visit in order to finish it. Meli and Celino's turbulent past and unknown future are just that impossible to ignore. Fans of antagonism to attraction romances will feel at home here. Best of all, Meli's myriad reasons for wanting Celino to die by the fire of a thousand suns are completely warranted. There is no easy resolution for reconciliation, let alone for these two to become a couple. Nevertheless, there are some seriously hot moments for Meli and Celino, and for those who are familiar with Ilona Andrews, Silent Blade is more along the lines of The Edge novels than the Kate Daniels series romance-wise, which is at times more spelled out than I'd like. As always, the space colonized world is both effortless to grasp and rich in every detail. I loved the vivid, touchable, and atmospheric setting of New Delphi. I have not forgotten the conjured images of colorful flowers, heady scents, and earthy architecture.  I understand why the leap in time at the resolution was necessary to the plot but in a shorter format, it felt abrupt. (Perhaps I just wanted more?) I appreciated the hard-earned ending for Meli and Celino though, and look forward to reading more Kinsmen novellas. If you're an Ilona Andrews fan and you haven't read Silent Blade yet, what are you waiting for? It is a must-read.","09 9, 2012",A2H3K2V5QXP0XM,Hollybally,1347148800

The story resembled something  written for young teens, the characters flat, the story rushed. Luckily I was bored  and had nothing else to read so i stuck with it. Once they got out of the building the character's personalities grew as did the story. It bloomed out dragging you along by introducing a new form of  ""smart"" zombies but kept the ""shamblers"". The ""Smart"" zombies kept their thoughts and personality from before they were changed, grew smarter, could talk and became stronger the more they fed, and the ""shamblers"" were just your traditional stupid, non talking ""brainnnnnns"" type. Even though i am a die hard ""brainnnnns"" fan, I liked the new smart zombies. I liked how it showed the story from the zombies point of view. It was more of ""evolution"" than a ""invasion"" of zombies. Its about time zombies became as smart as vampires and take their place as something that could form its own society to feed off the weaker humans. Its soooo nice to see them as something other than a monster to just fear and bash their heads in. I can see great possibilities for the story to grow out to a new world order type thing where the zombies become the dominate species and humans battle for a spot to live and not be food.The typos and mis-labeled/named characters were distracting and confusing. There is a part where Nancy is slapping Jimbo and it says Fred. I had to read that section several times to understand it.

2062,B002OHD27U,"[2, 2]",5,"I'll start with reviewing my favorite story of the three novellas, The Sweetest Sin. I absolutely adore the two protagonists Landon and Julianna who were eloped five years ago. It should have been a happy ending but their marriage was annulled when Julianna's father, Lord Trevington, caught up to them and forced her to marry the Duke of Breckinhill. The story however, starts when five years later, Julianna, now a widow goes to Landon for help to save her sister Evelyn who their father has used to pay off his gambling debts. Naturally, Landon asks that she become his mistress in exchange for helping her find her sister. The book flowed rather nicely and despite it being a novella, I feel that it had a lot of depth and the characters, well drawn out. By the end of the book, I ended up rooting for both Landon and Julianna to get their happy ending. This story also introduces us to Evelyn who we will read about in the third book Sin's Mistress. I gave this novella &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.In A Wager of Sin, Bianca, now a widow makes a bet with Hawk (Landon's brother). If she wins, all her debts will be paid and if he wins, she becomes his mistress. Pretty simple, right? Apparently, Bianca was married to Hawk's best friend and Hawk felt responsible for his demise when he had an accident because they were drunk the night before. I also liked this story but not as much as I loved The Sweetest Sin. The story was fast paced and also very steamy, perhaps more steamy than the second book. I enjoyed reading about Hawk and Bianca and loved Bianca's transformation into a headstrong widow into an independent woman. I give this novella &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.The last book of the series, Sin's Mistress is about Evelyn, Juliana's sister, who we read out about in The Sweetest Sin. She was sold in exchange to settle her father, Lord Trevington's gambling debts to Raphael Sinclair, known as Sin. Apparently he has been lusting after Evelyn for quite some time and had planned Trevington's downfall so that he can have her in exchange. He takes her to his estate in Devon and introduces her into his life. I actually thought this novella was okay. And yes I admit, it is not my favorite. Despite the characters being well drawn out, I did not warm up to Sin asI hoped and I did not like Evelyn's transformation as much. I give this novella &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.I bought the Sin Anthology when it was on sale for $1.99 at Barnes and Noble a couple of years ago and I have been re-reading this anthology multiple times.

Start with one sexy Alpha male who is anxious to claim his mate. Add his chosen mate, who just happens to be a Puma. Into the mix add one bitch with the desire to take the mates place as pack Luna, and stir in humor, action and some very spicy bedroom action. Garnish with politics and pack protocol, and you have one fantastic book.Steel Beauty is the fourth of Dana Marie Bell's Halle Puma stories, and it is a fun book to read. There are places where I laughed out loud. The heroine, Belinda ""Belle"" Campbell has to face several hardships in the beginning of this book. The steps Belle takes once she gets to the Pack lodge to take her place as Luna are hilarious. The passage at the beginning of the book, with Belle and Rick texting each other is an imaginative use of technology and a great piece of comic relief. Belle continues to handle things with grace, humor and just a little bit of underhandedness. Do Belle and Rick get their happily ever after? Will Rick ever get the air horn away from Belle? Pick up a copy of Steel Beauty to find those answers.Dana Marie Bell writes such believable characters, and I became lost in the world of the Poconos Wolves and the Halle Pumas. I wonder if anyone else would have dared to pair an Alpha wolf and a Puma as life mates. I enjoyed the banter between Belle and Rick, and there were places she made me laugh out loud at the antics Belle got up to in order to thwart Gina over and over. I also cried at the pain and suffering she endured in order to make it to the happily ever after that she and Rick so richly deserved. I had never read the Halle Puma books before this one, but I bought the other three in the series after reading this one, because Dana Marie Bell created a world I wish I could go and visit, and I will time and again through these books.Originally posted at [....]","08 9, 2009",A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...",1249776000

My second attempt I finally gave up halfway through.  The author's writing style is to give a blow-by-blow account of EVERYTHING that happened, was said, or was thought, so for me, the story was much longer than it should have been. Catherine was portrayed as having a fear of her husband, but nothing I read indicated that he was in any way abusive towards her. Distant, yes.  Withholding of affection, definitely. Lacking manners, of course. But never abusive.  I couldn't get a handle on Adam especially when his lust overtook him (I literally grimaced reading some of his scenes, and I'm no prude).

We come to learn that she, with her 13 year-old son Connor, has recently (and secretly) left her husband.  This is her second partnering, as her first was with Connor's biological father.The opening interchange with the Housing Council's Mrs. Roberts really showed Izzy as someone who's uncomfortable with making sudden or rash seeming decisions. However, she doesn't want her hesitation to best her either.  This is supported later with her expressed regret to Alana that she should have left her husband years ago.At the end of this transaction, the mystery of Coombe's Woods begins:  Why was Mrs. Roberts staring?  What was with the ornate walking cane?  Izzy has seen it before, but where?Later as Izzy's back story is divulged to the reader, the memory of the cane returns to her: Connor's dad had one similar to it and he was also from Cedham (where they've just moved to).  Now we know that something deliciously interesting could be in the mix.I'm a fan of the story so far.The writing, however, did stall in places with an overload of redundancy.  Some of it may have been necessary to convey a message to the reader, but using it as a tool too many times becomes, well, redundant.  I felt the following portions were examples:~To take the flat now or not...in Mrs. Roberts office.  In the end it seemed a good use to demonstrate Izzy's character.~The scene with writing on Connor's room's wall.  I know that this was to hit a point home, but I felt it played a little too long.Lines of comment:~'Izzy half expected an onion to be pulled from the desk drawer... Eat this apple, she'd say.'  I liked this one.  Plays into the whole theme.~'Take care in the woods. That's what that odd woman had said.' Followed by a description of what Izzy sees outside.  While I like the mini-scene, it would work better to have Izzy 'see' first then have that cause her recollection.Just nitpicks really.Overall, I like the originality of the story's premise and the author's writing is clever and engaging enough to keep my interest.

I understand why the author took us way back to when Payton and Lizzie met.  I just didn't understand why there was so much information and some of it really didn't do anything for the story.  This book probably could have been 4 chapters shorter and it still would have been fine.  There were other things that the author did later in the book that I didn't understand.  Why make Lou Anne part of the master plan?  Why would a grown man take his grown date back to the HS cafeteria for a pizza date?  I know that the author tried to throw in some story about when they were teenagers and he took her to the cafeteria, but it seemed like an afterthought.  That little tidbit should have been included in all the other information in the beginning of the story.  I didn't find the prom thing romantic or fitting to the story at all.

It is very graphic with violence, but I didn't think it was much worse than some of the thrillers that are out there today that I've read.  The two authors collaborating on this agreed that one mind was as sick as the other, and I'll agree, but I think the plot of two serial killers working alone and then what happens when the two of them meet up is very clever.  I read this very fast because I couldn't wait to see what happened.  This isn't SERIAL UNCUT, but a shorter version of it.  If these two writers intended to make me feel a little creepy, unnerved, like I had to keep reading, and totally entertained, then they accomplished their goal.  If you love thrillers and horror, something that gives you a very unsettled feeling, then this is for you. This is the first time I've seen the term ""recreational murder"" in any kind of mystery or suspense thriller.  I hope that's one term that doesn't become popular.There are three other excerpts from books included:  Desert Places by Blake Crouch, Shaken by J.A. Konrath, Draculas by J.A. Konrath, Jeff Strand and F. Paul Wilson.There is a list of each authors' works that are available for the Kindle at the end of the last excerpt. I didn't recognize the name of J.A. Kornrath, but he's the author of the Jack Daniels thriller series which includes Whiskey Sour and Bloody Mary.  I've read Whiskey Sour and enjoyed that one.

Heat of Passion also gives readers a little insight into Lieutenant Will Charleston whose story I am now aching for and I will be rushing to read his story, Heat of the Storm, very shortly.A passionate, engaging story that I could not put down, I cannot say enough good things about Heat of Passion or Ms. Kennedy's work.

I kept wanting to say, ""Whoa, slow down.  Let's learn about the characters before they go running off to be super heroes.""The Devlin Group is a group who stops Big Bad things from happening - like spreading poison all over Gitmo.Alex Rossi is the Super Hero leader who, at one time, worked with Grace, the Super Heroine. They were a great team with both of them equally able to get to the bad guys.  Alex also doubles as Sean Devlin, the founder of the Group.  He named the group Devlin to flush out the man who killed his Mother 11 years ago.  Grace was not aware of this story.  Alex and Grace had a baby but Alex was never told about him because Grace wanted to keep the baby, Danny, safe from the Super Hero's enemies.  All of this is for naught as Danny is kidnapped.  While this sounds somewhat complicated, Stacey does a good job of keeping things clear and the reader is never confused as to the story line.There are two other major characters, Carmen and Gallagher, who also help with the Devlin Group.The downside is that this adventure/romance is told so fast that there is little character development.  I know about as much about Carmen and Gallagher as you do right now. There was a whole story there left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, and the book would have been much better if Stacey had taken the time to allow the reader an insight into these two characters.Alex and Grace are somewhat better developed but still leave a bit to be desired.  Grace comes off somewhat naive in the ways of motherhood, to put it nicely.  For some reason we never know, she thinks being able to make cookies is more important in the raising of a child than allowing said child to get to know his father.  Go figure.  I still want to know what makes Grace tick.Stacey has talent but needs to learn a little about character development.  If the reader knows the characters, they care what happens to them.  While this is an exciting story, I never really cared if the characters lived or died except for what would happen to the child.","10 17, 2009",A109E01LB4H38F,"Carol Donaho ""Carol Donaho""",1255737600

10831,B002RKRMSY,"[0, 0]",5,"It's an oldie but a goodie. That's what I like to say about books that are written so long ago and yet they still remain relevant and entertaining. A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception. While the original publication goes back to 1864, it is a fun romp nonetheless. It should be noted that, over the years, different translations of the book have been made. This version from Amazon comes at the low, low cost of free. One notable difference between this translation and the original is that the name of one of the main characters is changed. But these things are trivial, as the story of a professor, his nephew, and a loyal guide is entertaining the whole way through.The Good: There were a few things I really liked about this book. First, the adventure. The excursion into the unknown was fascinating. Nevermind that what happens in the book could never actually be real; when you are reading the story you imagine that it is. You feel the danger and suspense as the three explorers go deeper into the earth and discover many fascinating things. Also, I found it interesting that the story is written as if it is an actual, educational account. Throughout the entirety of the book, the narrative explains the meaning of certain scientific terms and past discoveries that are relatable to what the explorers see and experience. It certainly is a fun journey to follow them as they make their way to the center of the earth!The Bad: One problem with a book that is so old is the terminology and phrasing. There are many words and phrases used that we just don't use today. At times, I had some trouble understanding exactly what was being described or talked about. For instance, on more than one occasion it mentions how the explorers stopped to have ""repast"". This isn't a term most would use today, and it simply means they stopped to eat or have a meal. Also, the pacing in the beginning is a little slow, and the real fun of the adventure does not begin until about a third of the way through the book.The Ugly: This one is not really a fault of the book, after all, I have to take the time period it was written in into account. This book has seen a few adaptations in the film industry. The result is that I was expecting some of the things I have seen in the movies. Despite all the wonderful things seen on their journey, all of what they see is plausible for the time period written. Instead of finding areas with lack of gravity or floating rocks, the explorers happen upon a world stuck in the far past, thousands of years before their journey. All of it, in a sense, was real at one point. Many of the movies today depict things that have never happened in the earth's history, and fantastical things that it will probably never see either. If you are expecting an account following what has been shown in film, you may be disappointed.Overall, I really liked A Journey to the Centre of the Earth. It was fun to see into the past in more way than one and appreciate the perspective of a science fiction writer from a century and a half ago. I highly recommend you read this, if you haven't already. This is classic science fiction. Like I said at the beginning, it's an oldie but a goodie.","02 12, 2011",A1U01JOXA2RT8Q,Benjamin Young,1297468800

It was well written in the sense of being able to understand the author's point, but not in the sense of a highly entertaining read. Argus, the main character, was memorable in his attempt to uncover the truth of his ordeal, while at the same time fighting his personal demons. I did like his character very much throughout the entire book. Sarah, Argus's wife, was pretty shallow in my estimation, considering she knew of his mental disorder when they married. The villain, when revealed in the end, was more of a let down given they had no more sinister reason than making a public statement basically in an extreme fashion.

I can see that.&#8221; But it&#8217;d been years since my early OMG-I-LOVE-Ilona binge, so I decided a reread was in order.And here we are.Some time in the indeterminate future, when space colonization was the new Big Thing, humans began to genetically enhance themselves. They needed to be stronger, faster, heartier, more versatile. Some of these enhancements were tech-based, effecting only the individual, and some were biological, being inherited by offspring.&#34;It was quickly realized that the advantage of these biological enhancements lay in their exclusivity. Thus, the biologically enhanced united and shut down all further biological modification.&#34;And consolidated their power. They were called the Kinsmen, and to maintain both the potency and exclusivity of their enhanced blood, the families arranged marriages for their children based on bloodlines and business alliances.This is why Meli Galdes was betrothed to Celino Carvanna when she was 10 years old and he was 16.While neither of them was happy with the arrangement, Meli accepted it, but Celino did NOT. He worked the next 6 years to make himself indispensable to his family, and worth more as an individual than the alliance with the Galdes family.And he succeeded.But where did that leave Meli?An excellent question. And one you will only get the answer to by . . . wait for it . . . yes, that&#8217;s right&#8212;READING the book. *winsome face*Verdict: a quick, fun, and SEXY read.

Once again, being a wolf is *important*, and Arend tackles the whole wolf-mating-shifting thing really well. Like Book 1, we finish somewhat suddenly. It is a bit HEA-for now. But I'm cool with it. It's a good, different, spicy paranormal romance.3.5 stars because I really did find it hard to get into the story.

10122,B000JMKNQ0,"[4, 4]",5,"Karen Traviss was noted during her time as a Star Wars author for her fascination with the Mandalorian culture along with her disdain for the Jedi. These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.","03 15, 2012",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",1331769600

I didn't like the characters and found the background story on the main characters wasn't developed enough for me to care.  I think the author did herself a disservice because this first novel felt very rushed and incomplete.  We were immediately thrown into the action with characters we had not yet had a chance to get to know and care about.  Then again, what was there to like about the ignorant, money-grubbing Daisy, cunning and crafty Aiden or Peter the Lunk Head?  I was appalled when Aiden admired Daisy's intelligence when she was going on about her business plan talking about ""those people"" (Koreans) so ignorantly I actually winced while reading.  She didn't sound smart; she sounded like a bigot and a hick and someone too young and experienced to have a clue about the world outside of Hollow Creek, KY...which I guess is what she was.  Aiden was so outrageously conniving it was almost comical.  All he needed was a long mustache to twist while laughing maniacally over Daisy tied to a railroad track and the image would have been complete.  Peter was such a chest-thumping, keep-the-woman-barefoot-and-pregnant caveman that the moments where he was supposed to be breaking down and showing his softer side almost didn't make sense.  Also, when Daisy's big (and obvious) secret was finally revealed in a dramatic (and predictable) fashion to Peter; I didn't feel sorry for either character.  I was actually very happy that this little bit of drama had finally come to its predictable conclusion.On a side note:  I found it extremely annoying that Daisy and Peter kept referring to Jessiemae but we never met her.  Here was a character that sounded like she might have a little bit of complexity and she never makes an appearance in the story!!Anyway, I downloaded the second novel, Daisy's Choice, right after completing this bit of fluff and it immediately became apparent that the author tried to make up for what was lacking in the first novel by giving more background on these characters.  But at this point, I find these characters so revolting and unendearing that I no longer care to see them get to, what I suspect, is just another predictable happily ever after.  I returned the second novel and am certian I won't ever reread Aiden's Game.  This is not to say that I am finished with this author because I know she can do better than this trio of stereoptyped, two-dimensional characters.","03 6, 2013",A1KYENSZAYYICL,V. Russell,1362528000

Bell's conversations are delightful--they are the kind of laughing interactions I have with my own friends (er, minus the sex).  Additionally, there was a great sweetness to the romance that was a treat to read.So here's my tip: if you want to really enjoy this book, read a quick primer on Norse mythology first.

7476,B000R93D4Y,"[8, 8]",5,"Magical, Mystical, Sensual . . . Enjoyable! While definitely all about the sex, this story brings a clear plot and a well-thought world in which our heroes and heroine have the pleasure of interacting. Perhaps I should say heroes and heroines . . . as the dragons are most certainly a major player in the plot of the story.There is never any inter-species hanky panky occurring, but the plot outlines a world where the dragon and its rider are so connected that both the dragon and rider are able to share feelings - including the sexual urges and desire that occur when the dragon is coupling with its mate. Of course, those feelings are intense, and of course they last for a very long time. (Dragons may be able to keep it in check for a very long time, but when they let loose . . . one should apparently be ready for almost anything!)The shared feelings and a lack of available females leads to an openness within the community around sex, and while there is no voyeurism involved, interaction may not be entirely behind closed doors . . . especially during a wedding! The lack of females also leads to an accepted practice of knights sharing mates - which is the case in this particular story. While there are sexual interactions between Gareth and Belara only, once Belara and her mother are brought back to the lair, that quickly changes, and Lars is added to the mix.There is an attempt made to slowly introduce the reader to multiple partners and all of the sexual exploits that situation can bring about. But, truly, there is lots and lots of sex in many different ways, shapes and forms. Outside of the sex, the plot does continue, and there is an epic battle scene described, and Belara's mother encounters the healing powers of a dragon. It's after this battle that Belara finds her dragon healing powers, and further cements her place within the community.A brief note: I was not especially happy with the ending of this story. It is a ""happily for now"", but it does set itself up to lead directly into a new book . . . a continuation of the story. Although not labeled as part of a series, the front cover lists the story as ""Dragon Knights"" - leading me to believe we will encounter this dragon community again, if not these particular characters again. That isn't a bad thing.A nice combination of fantasy and sex, this book is a nice one to pick up and lose yourself in!

The victim has an odd injury in his private parts--two small puncture wounds. And even odder he was drained of blood. One of her suspects, sexy Bo Strongwell keeps turning up everywhere. She just doesn't trust his story that he's part of the 'neighbohood watch' and that he's her sister's apartment 'building manager'. What's up with that? And why does he keep nibbling on her when they kiss? While working the case, she learns there's a lot going on in her town that she ever knew about--and her job is on the line!This book was just OK. The storyline of the book was pretty good, but it really needed a good line editor to suggest parts that could have been cut out and streamlined. It tended to drag and bog down in parts. I got tired of some of the repetitive stuff....like run ins with annoying Dirk, how many times we had to hear it had been five years since Elena had sex, etc. The character development was weak--I didn't connect with either of the main characters. I would have liked more development of the relationship between Bo and Elena. Seems like they had sex, and then boom they are supposedly in love.This is the second book I've read by Mary Hughes. Biting Nixie was the first, and I enjoyed it a good bit more than this one. It was much more funny, better paced, and had good character development. If you are trying this author for the first time, I suggest starting withBiting Nixie (Biting Love).

But can the four of them find a happy, albeit erotic, future together, or is it really just a fairy tale?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) erotic romance.- 3329 kindle locations (finishes around 3200 locations)- m/f - varied, explicit, caring. Some bdsm-lite behavior including hot wax, erotic spanking, mild humiliation, Dominant Alpha males, anal play. No m/m (brothers). Aiming for a committed foursome.- Quite a few editing and proofreading issues on my e-version. Enough to irritate and detract from this reader's enjoyment.Opinion:A very relationship-driven erotic romance following our Goldilocks as she takes on her three were-bears. Not a menage - Oriana never takes on more than one bed partner at a time - but highly erotic and varied as the Men show their different tastes. I liked Oriana - she was sweet and caring and very willing to go with the flow. She needed somewhere to just *be* and someone to simply love her. Getting three sexy men just makes it all the more fun. It's enjoyable, nicely written, and an easy way to pass the time.3.5 stars because of the editing issues, rounded up to 4 because Fanning made Goldilocks work, and made me laugh.Aside:Reminded me a lot ofMikayla's Menby Abby Blake - a sweet, easy woman who just wants to find a comfortable place to be loved.

Apparently, this means now that she's entered his domain, she's surrendered to whatever he wants, which he tells her is her ""body, mind and spirit.""Moments after he tells her this, she's inexplicably, violently crazed with lust until he satisfies her (quite easily), then as she tries to fight him, he subdues her with sex again, then he builds her up and demands she wears his collar, which she agrees to in a haze of lust.  He ties her up because he knows when the magic wears off, she'll be ticked off and try to leave him before he can do the sex mojo thing on her again.It's all explicit and if you like that kind of thing without it being necessarily erotic or having any emotional element, than you'll enjoy this.  Tessa and Kortal have absolutely no emotional connection; she's his possession from the moment she walks into his office and she's struck deaf and dumb with lust immediately because of some super mind-bending ability of his; when he's not around, she comes to her senses, then loses them again when he returns.This is from Ellora's Cave, and if you're familiar with them, this particular story would fit with their Exotica collection in my opinion (it contains stories that are more unusual, push boundaries and don't necessarily include affection or happily ever afters), although I don't think this writing is up to par with the authors that are generally included in that series.","07 12, 2010",A1TFMR7RE985MF,Countess Chocula,1278892800

Yes.Is it appropriate for home school as a textbook? No.Is it appropriate as supplemental reading? Yes.Are the Tom Swift, Jr., books that follow the main collection worth reading? No. No. Nonononono. I couldn't get through a single one of the books without dozing off. There is too much science--a very early use of computers, but Tom still uses a slide rule--too much bad science, and too little personality. The characters are totally wooden, and in the original series, although the characters tend to be repetitive, they are fairly realistic as characters.Would today's teenager, totally used to all the miracle inventions, be impressed by these books? Would he or she enjoy them? Maybe, but only if the teenager can accept last century's stereotypes without becoming offended.My husband is just enough younger than I am that he remembers enjoying the Tom Swift Jr. books. I never saw them. What I read was my father's original Tom Swift books, scrounged from my grandparents' attic. I remember having to explain word usage to my brother, when he was complaining that they blamed everything on the confederates, and had to be told the difference between Confederates and confederates.Not only did I thoroughly enjoy reading these books, which included a number of Tom Swift's I'd never seen before, but in fact--with 52 more years behind me and a Ph.D. in English--I found them much better than I had thought they were when I was in high school.There were at least two writers in the first series, with a third who showed up near the end. One of the writers never did any research, and invented entire cities in major countries out of his head. He had a fight between a lion and a tiger in India and had a fight between two tigers in Africa--in the SAME BOOK. The second did very heavy research and the difference shows; although at times he becomes rather pedantic, in general the research is well used.I can't possibly give this more than a 3 rating, largely because of those horrible Tom Swift Jr. books but partly because some of the plots were reused in a very short series, and one got very tired of childhood feuds being carried on into adulthood. Also, continuing to call Tom a ""boy"" when the chronology of the series makes it clear that he must by now be in his early twenties and being idiotically coy about Tom's courtship make for painful reading even for a teenager.","11 30, 2010",A2WW9T8EEI8NU4,Anne Wingate,1291075200

There's things to like here; the concept is amusing (for the short form, girl gets murdered by boyfriend, hires a P.I. to help find her body, wacky hijinks ensue), the writing style and voice are clear and entertaining, and the technical aspects of the work are well done.Why only two stars, then? Primarily because it feels disjointed, and a trifle incomplete. Scenes just sort of happen, with little rhyme or reason. There's one point that the dead woman is &#34;teasing&#34; the PI in the shower, seemingly with no better explanation than &#34;because reasons!&#34; There's several sequences featuring an almost painfully flaming gay man that, while perhaps funny, seem almost ridiculously overblown when compared to the relative down-to-earth tropes and characterization of the other players. The boyfriend-slash-murderer also manages to land himself in the unbelievable category, apparently having a secret gay side, huge amounts of debts and bizarre culinary skills that are never explained and clash with the manner of presentation.Overall, I think it's the illogic of the thing that bothered me the most. To me, for something to be humorous - which Dead(ish) seems to be attempting - it has to make sense, by it's own rules and logic if by no other judgement... and Dead(ish) seems to fall short on that score. With a bit more content - filling in some of the blank spots, detailing the character motivations and backgrounds a bit more - I'd say there's enough spark here to warrant at least 3 and perhaps a 4 star rating. But it's not quite there, yet.Also, final warning - and one that's echoed on Amazon's page - but there's a boatload of foul language and obscure Aussie slang in here, so be prepared if such things are not on your &#34;okay&#34; list, or be prepared to do some websearching to sort out the slang.","06 4, 2014",A3AH51C0ZZQG3B,Patrick Dixon,1401840000

Since I read the other two out of order, I went back and started at the beginning.  Rachel Myers is a very appealing character because of her dedication to everything she does, and she is a very kind and moral person.  Coming from the mountains of North Carolina, a beautiful area of the country, she is used to making her own way in the world and also is used to hard work.  At the beginning of this series, she is a nursing administrator for a retirement home in Flagstaff, AZ.In this novel, Rachel has returned from Arizona, where she now lives, to her father's farm in North Carolina to attend his funeral. He had suffered a heart attack and was found in his home by Isaac, an old friend of her father's who lives on the farm property and helps with the work of the farm and kept her father company.  It comes to Rachel's attention that another friend of her father's from the past had become very interested in her father and his farm and had talked him into making some improvements on his property that weren't really necessary, and that had cost much more than Rachel's father would normally spend.  In addition to everything else, the housekeeper that Rachel's father had had for years, was now fired and gone. Something just wasn't right.When Rachel and Isaac together find out some other suspicious facts, Rachel knows that it is time to find out the truth about her father's estate, both the property and the money, and why certain things just aren't adding up.  Isaac is a great support to Rachel as she tries to find out what went on during the time since her last visit home.The descriptions of the North Carolina scenery on the trails that Rachel rides her horse on and of the mountains around the farm are a delight to read about, and are authentic since the author is a native of North Carolina.There is suspense, mystery and pleasant times with old friends in BLIND MALICE.  Now that I've read this one, it's on to another in this series.  These are very enjoyable mysteries.","12 8, 2011",A14QJKY3DA19AP,S. Warfield,1323302400

He works for a company that assesses the environmental impact of logging operations, but life and tragedy long ago caused him to set aside his idealistic, green principles. Regina is married to the boss of the logging operation, a man who pretty much owns the town of Crow's Landing and doesn't care who he tramples in his pursuit of success and financial gain. Throw in Regina's troubled teen, Michael, and Quinton's part Native American heritage and the conflicts start to pile up, especially when Regina and Quinton meet and the spark between them cannot be denied. These two troubled souls can't ignore their attraction for each other, despite the risks. Their budding relationship renews their enthusiasm for life and gives them both hope that happiness is possible again. But the tensions in Crow's Landing reach snapping point and when the logging mill burns down, somebody has to pay.

11483,B0038AUZ4A,"[0, 1]",5,"When Catch Me If You Can came up for review on another site that I review books for, I eagerly snatched it up. Although I've never read anything by Ms. Gregg before, I'd heard her name mentioned by several people whose opinions I value and they've all lauded her work. So, I read it and . . . it was a nice read.The dialogue was witty and fun. And I felt sorry for Caesar who seemed to have the weight of the world on his shoulders. I appreciated the way he never bitched and moaned about all these problems that were heaped up on him. He didn't sit down and have a pity party like so many characters often do. He just jumped in and tried to find solutions, in his unique and odd way which added to the charm of Catch Me If You Can.The mystery inside Catch Me If You Can seemed to be more of a comedy of errors instead of anything serious or focused. To give a good comparison, I felt like I was watching Ethel and Lucy from I Love Lucy. I don't know if this is because of what I do in my day-to-day job, but I was seriously annoyed that no one called the police or anything. Their reasoning behind not doing so was flimsy and didn't ring true. I freely admit that this may be a bias on my part since I interact with the police on a daily basis.The relationship between Caesar and Dan was nice. The respect they had for each other had the makings to develop into something more powerful as time goes on, but I would've liked to see a little more depth between the two of them. There were so many secondary characters that Caesar and Dan's developing relationship didn't appear to be the focal point of Catch Me If You Can. I missed that, I wanted to see Dan and Caesar develop and struggle through their trust issues to see if they'd make a go at it. This was barely glanced at.Overall Catch Me If You Can is a fun and breezy read. You'll laugh out loud several times at some of the dialogue. While I love lite books, I felt that the comedy aspect overwhelmed the development of Caesar and Dan's relationship, which in my humble opinion should've been the focal point.COURTESY of CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES","03 24, 2010",A3P4V9UX4YMZ1W,"L.

The most indepth mysteries if have read are Stephanie Plum lol so I cannot base my opinion very well on the mystery genre. So I will just base it upon my experience with smut. :)******************SPOILERS***********************Yes there were holes in the story that didn't add up. He owns a security company but didnt set the cameras up properly? Quitting the military to look after disabled brother? Sending Gramma off to condo living and not knowing that the house that had been in the family for years had a secret passage? Max still thinking the vandals were kids? I could go on and on about how the author thinks the readers are not bright and wouldn't pick up on all the plot holes. So instead of writing what I didn't like, I can write what I did like??I liked how Max and Ryan met. That made me smile. I felt their attraction to each other when Ryan came to her house to inspect for security. I thought the author did a great job making the reader ""feel"" their attraction instead of just writing ""Max likes Ryan"". When they were both so incredibly drawn to each other but needed to maintain a professional reserve was amusing to read.I liked that Ryan and Max didn't just sleep together the first time and it took a bit for them to do so.I really like how well the author orchestrated the smut scenes. (okay epic thesaurus fail on turgid penis)I thought they were hot and well paced. Well paced in the sense that, after the first time, BAM! they were not hopelessly in love. (I really hate when authors do that)I thought it was interesting to add the storyline about her ex Jamie being a lousy lover and how he made Max shower first or no oral or intimate touching etc. If her previous boyfriend was her only experience and that's what he made her do or what they did, then that's all she knows. I loved how the author wrote regarding Ryan getting her out of that frame of mind. It was like it's own little story within the story.I also enjoyed the ending. I felt Max had really grown since the beginning of the book and I liked her change. I was super happy that the book did not end with having a baby or something. God I hate how books end with babies.So yes, major plot holes and unlikely situations but I still liked it. Question is would I buy the next Turner book? My answer is no.

1943,B0030H262A,"[1, 1]",5,"In the year 3478, the Burning War has left Earth - or Terra as it's now known - a devastated, backward world that's lost three-quarters of its population to not only war, but to tsunamis, earthquakes, and a plague that would have entirely wiped out humanity had the Triune Goddess Morrigunia not interceded. Floods and earthquakes have reduced the size of what used to be the United States by half. The people exist now in a futuristic ""old west"" in which the large cities and their machinery of old lie in ruin. In what had been the vast Midwest, the Southwest, and Southeast, the land has been divided into territories ruled by the High Council of Shadowlords -- three powerful psychics from far beyond the Terran galaxy. Rogue reapers called Balgairs have been turned loose by the alien Ceannus to destroy the humans of Terra. To eradicate them before this happens, the High Council has brought in seven of Morrigunia's Reapers.Reapers are forces to be reckoned with. Tall,dark-haired, and inordinately handsome and well-built, these men each possess a symbiotic worm that gives them the strength of 10 normal men. Neither vampire nor werewolf, but a combination of both, they can shapeshift into both a wolf and a bird. Their senses are enhanced, and they have powers to mesmerize and do all manner of magical things. Tough, unsympathetic killers, they'll melt your heart with the loneliness and despair they hide from the world but cannot hide from the women destined to be their mates. Ultimately, they are the final word of law in the Territories, and nothing is more important to them than the protection of their people. Yet the people they've dedicated their lives to protecting fear these solitary blood-drinking Reapers nearly as much as they fear the blood-thirsty Rogues.In between assignments, Reaper Eanan Tohre has spent centuries as the Triune Goddess Morrigunia's plaything, the replacement for the man the Goddess really wanted as her consort, Eanan's twin brother Owen. When the Goddess took Owen off for the duration of his sentence in the Citadel's con cells for taking a mate and turning her into a Reaper without the Shadowlords' consent, she replaced him with Eanan.Once the sentence was served and Morrigunia no longer needed Eanan to suffice for his brother, Eanan was left as the Citadel to serve the Shadowlords. But he has another purpose. The Goddess has promised him to the Gatekeepers: Argent Ben-Alkazar, Corallin Tarnes, and Aureolin Belvoir. Virgins and sisters from the same mother, the three women want to experience the passion and companionship the Reaper wives and mates are enjoying. They each have their own sexual needs and desires, and it takes a versatile and experienced man like Eanan to complete them.When they summon him, he knows not why. Commanded to sit and be quiet in their presence, he wriggles around in discomfort under their sensual scrutiny, their lusty looks setting his black blood on fire. When they tell him to strip or be stripped, the wide-eyed Reaper has no choice but to do as he's ordered.Embrace the Wind differs from Charlotte Boyett-Compo's customary Reaper and rogue-filled cowpunk that makes the WesternWind series so unique and exciting. Though it's fast-paced and as well-written as any of her books, this short novella is missing the action I so love about this series, but it shows us the author's lighter side, with some good old-fashioned bedroom romps that are sexy, amusing, poignant, and yes...even sweet. Plus, it's fun to see the sisters dish out some comeuppance to their scowling, growling brothers, particularly the obnoxious Kheelan.I didn't like Eanan when he was first introduced in WesternWind 4: Tears of the Reaper. After all, even if you can overlook his slitting his brother's throat, there's the fact that he's been an irreverent cad ever since. But he grew on me as he began to redeem himself not only with Owen, but with the other Reapers and of course with the Shadowlords. He displays some heartfelt perceptiveness and concern in worrying whether Aureolin and Corallin would feel slighted when he choses Argent as his first wife. The budding love between Eanan and Argent is touching.Like all the books in the series, this book is best if read in sequential order, particularly since Eanan's story actually begins in book 4. -- This review belongs in its entirety to TwoLips Reviews, LLC.","02 8, 2013",APGY8ZJ7Q858L,"The Fat Fairy ""the_fat_fairy""",1360281600

There was plenty of build-up regarding the wood, but very little actual action within the borders of the wood.

Most readers will enjoy the story so long as they aren't expecting something more in line with 'horror'.  The writing was done well, the characters were believeable, though not always likeable (I personally did not LIKE Izzy at all, though I could sympathize with her), and Kindle formatting was fine.

I mean it is not really that often you get a really great Dragon shifter story, an erotica one at that. Well, this was yet again not one of those good ones. In the vain attempt to not make this ranty, because I honestly have no reason to rant, I got it for free so it would just perpetuate the cycle of silly to rant about this short story. Which, to be honest, I have read so many great ones recently I was bound to come across one I didn't really like that much. So in that respect I'm going to say what I liked and what I didn't like and be as respectful as I can to the author.What I liked-I like Rajah. He was a great Alpha male and he really fit into the environment and the world that was created. It was supposed to be other worldly with an old world flare. With the way he talked and his attitude he fit. The concept was honestly a great idea. If you were to run with the general idea and mould it in the proper fashion it had amazing potential. The whole idea that there are Dragon shifters and they will snatch up you're pretty virgin butt if they sniff you out is just hot. The sex was honestly rowdy and downright dirty, she didn't hold back and I liked that. The words were raunchy and I was like ""MEOW!"" I wanted to blow my own flames.What I didn't like-With that being said we get down to the basics of why this short fell short. First off, the story is named after the female lead and she was migraine inducing. Larkspur is a `dolphin' shifter and a virgin, though you could have fooled me. The girl acted offended by being pawed at for a total of 3.5 seconds before she was naked spreading her legs. Yes, I get it's a short and you have a word count you are required to work with, but did she have to talk like a girl from the Valley in Southern California? Honestly, it didn't work for me. The moment Larkspur saw his `manhood' she changed. Her dialogue became unbelievable for the old world setting and she just said the daftest things. She ruined the story for me to be honest. When you use the term ""Well you do have a yummy looking c*ck."" And then have her spread her legs out, a supposed virgin that also doesn't feel any pain when said dragon man slides into her HARD mind you HARD! Make it just a little bit believable please!!!!!Needless to say I don't think I will be running out to get her other books based on this world, though I am curious if she runs the same theme with the women that are just so horribly unappealing.  I feel that this is a rant, I'm sorry that this is a rant but I was in bed reading this at 12am just going `Really! I stayed up for this!' I think I was just far too excited about it.","06 25, 2011",ASLSCL3KWHFSE,Future Slayer Girl (aka: kitten),1308960000

Allow me to give you some background: The heroine is married to an abusive husband who has lots of money and runs the town due to his control of the logging business there. She has one great kid and one delinquent and she is beaten down by her hubby and shows more annoyance than concern for her kids who obviously are dealing with their dysfunctioanl family in their own ways but need help. She takes crap from her husband, her kids, and pretty much everyone. The hero works for an environmental agency and sees the man's wife and smiles at her after which they go to infatuation and love.OK, if she is so terrified of her husband and doesn't have the nerve to leave him, where is she getting the nerve to have an affair on him in front of the whole gossiping town (her tramp friend takes her to dinner and they are seen by everyone eatting with the hero and his coworker)? Honestly, I'm not one for infidelity, even if she is cheating on her abusive/cheating husband - LEAVE HIM. I get that he is this controlling powerful guy, but if she is afraid to leave him, what does she think he'll do if she is cheating on him? This was compared to Bridges of Madison County, but it is not anywhere near as good as that - it may be about infidelity, but it does not have the same intensity - it's just not written as well.

Well, what can I say? The story got me caught up in it and I kept reading. It was a fun read and I enjoyed it very much.This is a story of a family who had recently lost their father and had to move from their home to their grandfather's ranch that their mother had inherited. They sold everything and packed up the car and headed to Promise, Oregon with just enough money to get there. Along the way things happen and they get separated from their mother and are on their own. With the fear of being picked up by the police and put in a foster home without any parents, they manage to get to Oregon on their own.The characters were believable, and once they got to their grandfather's farm, the story really took off for me.

The government was embarrassed so if you want to get married you need to fill out a questionnaire from the government and they'll pick your match. Rainy, does just that. She's at a point in her life where she's graduated, has a decent job, now she just wants someone to share her time with. Her father is a State Representative so in order to not embarrass him she fills out the questionnaire. Ashely Schroeder, the heir to a major appliance corporation does just the same and is paired with Rainy. You can probably figure out it doesn't go exactly as planned.I'll try to keep spoilers out of this but it may be difficult. I'd like to warn you that I'm about to throw a little spoiler out. Rainy, accuses Ashley of being an alcoholic and yet, hello? Maybe she should take a good look at herself! She got wasted the first night she met Ashley and his family. Talk about the pot calling the kettle? Also, why would she file an appeal without speaking to Ashley. When she finds out he's already filed for one she goes ballistic. So it's ok for her but not him? Then she proceeds to ignore him and all of his calls and correspondence for two months. Pot and kettle, my friend.I'm not sure I enjoyed this. I thought it was a bit too drawn out. I thought Rainy was a bit rude in some situations. When her and Ashley met for counseling she was terrible to him. I was cringing. Ok, obviously, their match wasn't perfect but she signed up for it the same as him. It's kind of a 50/50. Yeah his mom was terrible, yeah they didn't exactly have the same views on what a marriage was all about, yeah the government got it wrong but at least Ashley tried to suck it up and tried to be nice to her.I think that this could have been a little better. I feel there were some things that were just thrown in for length. Like when she was putting around her museum. We pretty much could have skipped most of that. I didn't hate this book, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone either.  It had a lot of good ideas but I also felt a lot of contradictions as well. Especially, with Rainy's family.

119,B001NPDA44,"[0, 0]",5,"I initially bought the official K2 leather cover, and it was generally fine.  But I eventually decided that I'd like a cover/case that completely encloses and cushions the Kindle, as I tend to carry it around a lot, toss it in the car during trips, etc.  So I bought the Belkin Neoprene Sleeve Case after seeing and reading about it on Amazon.  And, happily, it turned out to be a great purchase, handsome and functional.  I especially like the way the cushioning inside isolates the Kindle from the zipper, so there's no danger (unless you're really, really careless, or maybe drunk) of scratching your Kindle while zipping or unzipping the case.And even though this is a soft product, there's just enough stiffness to the Belkin Case to prevent the material from settling down and sitting on the Kindle screen when you place the covered device down somewhere.  Though there's really no harm if that does occur, as the Kindle sits snugly in the case and won't move around and create friction between the inside surface and the screen.So, yeah, this is a very nice product, and it's economically priced, to boot.  Why not five stars, then?  Well, unlike the stiff official K2 cover, this is still a soft case that won't allow you to safely place anything of weight on top of it, so the Kindle will always have to be on top of any pile of things you're carrying or placing in a carry-all bag.  And I always have to take the extra, perhaps slightly inconvenient, step of making sure my grip is pressuring the keyboard area, not the more sensitive screen area, when I'm carrying the case around.  But these are quibbles.  There's yet to be a Kindle case or cover that perfectly addresses all concerns, and maybe it's not realistic to expect one.So, for now, if you're looking for a cushioned case that completely protects the Kindle from weather, scratches, minor bumps, and other things along these lines, you can't go wrong with the Belkin Case.","03 18, 2009",A3GRN6J64F2C3X,"Joseph P.

Not only is Core able to transform into something that appears both human and snake-like at the same time, his tat can even embody a powerful snake spirit that moves off his chest and becomes alive.I was fascinated by this idea of a snake-shifter. To be honest, snakes don't normally go hand-in-hand with sexy for me, but Core managed to pull it off. He kind of reminded me of a tough biker mixed with deadly warlord. Not only was he badazz and sexy, he was also sweet and protective of Mal. It turned out that he and Mal were each exactly what the other needed, in several ways, leading to a very sexy and magical relationship.This story is only 79 pages, but it gets a lot of story into those pages. Sure, sometimes it can seem a little rushed, but overall, the story is pretty creative and very interesting. Actually, it ended with me very much wanting to know more about this alien world, about a few of Core's fighters/friends, and most of all, wanting to find out more about this rival race called the Phrellians. There is definitely a lot more here for the author to revisit, and even room for her to go deeper. Rattler definitely needs a story.For a dollar, this was really a nice surprise. It had some action, interesting characters, and this other world, making for an intriguing mix of PNR with alien romance. And I have to say I've never read a book with a snake-shifter before, just very different to have this oddly sexy snake-man as a hero. All in all, a pretty good read,  short and hot, with a lot going for it, especially for the price. I'm not disappointed I bought it.","11 22, 2011",A37J3XRX1TENTS,S. Richards,1321920000

The visual descriptions and writing style are very, very good. The mystery falls into the cozy mystery style and is well thought out and plotted. The descriptions of flora and fauna are truly outstanding. Made this non-gardener want to go plant something.All that said, I did feel that Rachel and other characters could have been better developed. Personally, I probably would've enjoyed the book much more if I had gotten to know Rachel better. Hopefully, in future books of the series Rachel will be more fully developed and become more personable.I also wish the book had been longer. It reads more like a novella, which is fine, as it suited my mood at the time, but I think it should probably be labelled as novella rather than a novel. For me, a little more depth and length is required to truly merit the label novel and this lack of depth is what caused any disappointment I felt in the book.I liked Blind Malice enough,though, that I will certainly read more installments in the series and can recommend this first one to anyone who loves plants, flowers and gardening.

It starts off with a battle and the action continues throughout.  The author has created a post apocalyptic fantasy world with a unique twist and very engaging characters.The heroes, Marc and Blake, and the heroine, Kate, find themselves fighting on the same side against the demons set on destroying the world.  The emotional drama the characters find themselves in draws the reader into the story as Marc and Blake join Kate's military group to try to close the demon rip, and find themselves attracted to Kate. They each try to get her attention as they deal with their own personal issues with each other. Kate is equally attracted to them both, but doesn't know what to think or do about that, besides she is on a mission and doesn't need the complication.The reader's attention is also captured by the depth the supporting characters add to this drama filled story.  The well written battle scenes come to life in this intriguing tale and you can feel the chemistry building between the three main characters.  The sex in the story is very hot and leaves the reader wanting more.The author leaves us with not only a war cliff hanger, but a romantic cliff hanger as well, but she left us a great spot in the story.  This was a fantastic story and I will be reading more of the books in this series.","08 28, 2013",ASVY5XSYJ1XOE,Evampire,1377648000

Lyra, is an innocent girl she has a good heart and was raised by her adoptive mother, Nick isn't what he seems and Michael a sweet guy. The other characters also brought something to the book.What I didn't like even though the beginning got your interest, it started out slow.  Patience was the key in finishing the book for me.  In ebook format the length is around 5781, as it took time to get into the plot, the plot is what kept me going. Also for a book with such length the ending was not what I thought it would be, a disappointing ending.

The smallest, the slowest and the oddest looking {in her lion form} she really has no hope to get a man, or to have cubs of her own. On a mission to ""get some"" even if it is from a human in a random pick-up bar, Ava saunters into the local dive and sidles up to the best looking cowboy in the place. Her mission is just about accomplished when she senses her Alpha standing right behind her...""oops.""Resigned to being forced back to the ranch and lorded over by her four over-protective brothers - Ava would never expect that Alpha Landon would actually be hot for her and they would end up hooking up in her driveway. But as she begins to realize that it is probably just because she is in heat her fantasies about hooking the Alpha deteriorate. Well, at least she can have him for one night. That should be enough, right?Short and entertaining, Serengeti Heat was another great bit of PNR to come out of Samhain Publishing. The characters were charming and the setting was interesting. I definitely look forward to reading more from Vivi Andrews. My only negative regarding the book was that it wrapped up too nicely, but this is probably because of the word limit Samhain gives to these anthology novellas. I really expected a bit of back-lash from a few of the not-so-nice characters. ""Meow"" cat fight. Oh well.This is short read, and a very cheap listing, on amazon.com for $2.80 here.

11481,B0010ZGPB2,"[1, 1]",5,"From [...]I have never before read a book like Steve Peek's Long Claws.It is a thriller and a horror story. The tale unfolds with so much mystery, sections of the story delivered one chunk at a time, that you're held captive to its pages simply out of a desire to find out why something happened in a previous chapter. It's one of those books that keeps you saying, ""Okay, just one more page and then I'll mow the lawn."" And you keep saying it over and over until you're at the last page, not knowing how you got there so quickly.Mr. Peek tells the story from many perspectives, jumping around from character to character, revealing the bigger picture in stages. Normally, for me, this is a writing style that puts me off; I like to bond with my main character, and I don't like it when the narrative runs off to follow someone else. But with Long Claws, although there is a main character, the other characters that are touched upon are just as unique and interesting. With each turn of the tale, I was surprised to feel a little disappointed that I had to take leave of the character I'd just been following - that's a good thing. It means I was fully invested in each and every one of them, a strong testament to the author's skill.And here is the most amazing part: some of the characters followed are insects, some are werewolves (sort of), some are regular people, and others are people with special powers of awareness. Yes - insects. Steve Peek takes you into the minds and inner workings of a species of insects he's created. And he does it well.This story is epic. The majority of it spans the course of a fifty(ish) year period, but its roots go back tens of thousands of years. Modern mysteries and legends are woven into the fabric of new legends that are the foundation of this story.This isn't a story that begins with a bang. Do not put it down if you are not hooked by the first five pages. You will not be disappointed if you continue the story to its conclusion.","07 13, 2013",A3IT3XAOJKN59B,Matthew Keith,1373673600

Father Jenkins once stated ""she is conniving"" but didn't elaborate nor did it ever reveal what he meant by that.  I agreed and kept waiting for anything, something. Couldn't stand her.  Also, was Todd an idiot? He would have to be, I didn't buy the unconditional love and sexless marriage, maybe if they had been married for 10 years, but as newlyweds, no way.  I didn't like Jesus/Brother Michael - very creepy dude.  Very, very creepy. And his sidekicks and their women, very weird. Who were these morons? Couldn't he have found other disciples?

Scamming the citizens for their land? etc.  I do not know, I'm not religious, but in my mind - NO, at least not any God that I know of.  I liked Blaze/Father Jenkins until it was revealed he was a pedophile. What the heck was that all about?  What happened to Jim Donohue? He just dropped off the page never to return.  Why was Dr. Perez stalked and murdered? Never cleared that one up either.  What about the ""other girl"" who died in childbirth, how weird was throwing that paragraph in?

The female role was wonderful. She was strong and sexy, so cute, just what a leading lady should be. Not to mention our hero, Leo was just so amazing. I found myself wishing the book was longer. That was probably the only downside to this book was that it was only 9 chapters long. the author has to put a lot of description into a short book but it was done so well that it made up for it. this series is really good and I am anxiously awaiting the next book in the series to come out.

I can't believe the paper back is 14.99 - Kindle was .99 and I still feel cheated! I really liked the premise, but the actual writing and story line was just ""lacking"", so much. I kept reading hoping it would get better and it just got worse. I really wanted to like it, but. wow, it was bad. Here are a few reasons:- Poor editing, at least on the digital version. I find that truly detracts from any story no matter how good (and more so when it's not so good).- There was suppossed to be this sexual tension and subsequent sense of falling in love between the two characters and it just wasn't there. He avoided her and they barely spoke. Her family treated him horridly (based on his great great grandfather's previous treatment of her), and she basically went along with it. They never really spoke, so where's the love? Even when she believes he's a different person (which happened way too easily), they still never had the actual falling in love - they just were, and then the were in love. Lame.- He lookd like his great great grandfather so much that only the height and build are a bit off and no one notices? Really? People tell me I look just like my mom, and yet, if you were to put us together at the same age, we would look related but not enough to pass for one another. Yet he is practically an exact replica almost how many generations later? Lame. Then it happens again later (won't say how, but really, what are the odds?). Lame.- The use of cliches and colloquialisms in writng, especially narration of a story line, is just poor writing. Characters speaking in them can be justified if it is done to make a point or to embellish a time period, but if it is done repeatedly or anachronistically it just detracts from the story line and weakens the writing. It's also freaking annoying! :)- The end is just......ok, lame. I sense a pattern. So, yeah, if you were to ask me to sum up my review in one word, I guess we know what it would be. I'd go on about the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who still wants to read it. I do think the ending is just wrong though, and it harkins back to my sentiments about them truly being ""in love"". Well, maybe she was, but him, not so much.If you love time travel romance, the best I've ever read is ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon. An incredible book. An amazing series. It's not .99 cents, but It's worth every penny it costs for digital or hardcover. It's the quintessential time travel romance.

10523,B00480OPOK,"[0, 0]",5,"There are a few issues I have with this book, and a few questions too.First, after reading the synopsis I thought the idea of the story interesting enough to give it a go. The $0.00 price was a help in making that decision too. I've had a run of bad luck with some of the self-published books on amazon as far as their depth, intelligence, and attention to grammar and punctuation, so being free was a big Plus.In the first chapter, actually within the first few pages, some of the most intentionally unintelligent comments are made by the main character that made me instantly close-out of my Kindle for PC and go hunting for a different book to read. The part where the protag does something that no human should be able to do, but then attributes this strange ability to a weird ""coincidental gift from the universe"", or something just completely crushed any hope I had for the story. And then shortly after, when seeing something mysterious in a place she is not supposed to be and that poses great danger to her, she chases after it, I had to take deep calming breaths. Where's the underline in here? She CHASES it.But after a fruitless and halfhearted search for a different book, I returned to this one, determined to give its author the benefit of the doubt. I'm not about to go into further detail because it would only make me look like I was unhappy with how the story unfolded, and that's not the case at all. There were just so many inconsistencies and random acts of emotion and awkward mannerisms and social interactions it was frustrating at every turn.I found there to be multiple places throughout the story where the characters would say or do something totally alien to the set mood, or completely confusing to me. Reading this story was like looking into the mind of a mood swinging ADD spaz with wings and super powers. Her attention seemed to jump from one thing to the next so fast and sometimes seemingly so random I wanted to tell the character to sit still and be quiet for a minute. There's no continuous focus of one thing at a time, there's no consistency to the moods or attitudes of the characters, and above all- the action scenes were down right confusing. I'm not an accomplished writer, and no, I have not published anything I've written, but I do know a good fight scene, or action scene when I read one, and those in this story had me more confused than before the scene happened.Also, the dynamics between characters was hard to follow. Each time Breandan and Devlin were in the scene, all I kept thinking was ""WHY is he leaving her with Devlin when we all KNOW Devlin has bad intentions for Rae???"" or ""WHY did he just turn his back on an enemy after a supposedly vicious sword fight?"" There were so many ""Why?!"" thoughts after each scene containing the three characters I had to take breaks just to calm myself down from the frustration I was experiencing over it.The concept of the story is fascinating, and the characters individually are interesting and (evil personalities aside) are likable. But the conflicts of what the characters say versus what they actually do, and sometimes the mood swings they express are just confounding. There's no other way I can describe it without going into a full rant. I really wished this story were better because I think the world the writer had created is fun and it definitely sets my imagination whirling but the incongruity of the characters just ruined it for me.","11 28, 2012",A3QJQ870YZ5CFC,"M.

More simply, the author introduced multiple generations into the crime scenario so that neither the reader nor the hero was ever particularly clear as to just what the point was. If there was a point. There is a difference between complexity and confusion; the book reflects the latter far more than the former. There is also a problem, never resolved: linking the multiple murders and cases of mayhem, with a single thread as the denouement seeks to do. It never really gels in literary terms nor in terms of a satisfying conclusion.The book does have its virtues in the development of some of its characters and their traits, as well as in the creation of a sense of the confusion the only solution to which requires that the hero keep plugging along through a fog of deceit.Overall, not a book I can unconditionally recommend or condemn. I would not put myself into a situation in which this was the only thing I had to read with more than a few hours of journey ahead.

During the age (adolescence) when testosterone abounds, an older boy most certainly would have tried to capture the flag from protagonist Mike.The story is expertly developed, and the kids from the camp met with a great ending.

A few times it even switched to omniscient.  This was not only annoying, but extremely distracting.Also, one character seems to have some kind of secret that the author didn't want us to know, I assume until the end.  However, some of the story was even told from her viewpoint. Now, if you are basically in someone's mind, wouldn't you know their secret?One other point was that the emotions of the characters just seemed extreme. The main character would go from smiling & joking to an almost murderous rage from one sentence to the next. And, yet, no one seemed to notice his extreme emotional instability. They even referred to his 'boyish charm' or something like that.He seemed to me to be extremely emotionally unstable. Which is fine, but he wasn't hiding it & yet, no one seemed to notice.***Spoiler**** (not much of one since I didn't finish it, but wanted to warn)At one point, the main character's girlfriend tells the guy's best friend a story that leads the friend to think the main character had RAPED her.

There were grammatical errors, misspelled words and words in the wrong order. The book at times seems to be written from the first, second and even third point of view and the Kindle version even had different fonts alternating throughout. All of this took away from the story and the mistakes got even worse the closer you got to the end of the book.The plot seemed undeveloped. The heroine:Kat saw her mother murdered and was sent, by her father, to be raised by her uncle in the hopes that he would keep her safe. Why she was safer with him was never explained. She meets a boy: Kenji and falls in love with him. Kenji goes away, but years later Kat is reintroduced to him and told she must marry him per an agreement both of their families had made when they were born. The premise is that they both have powers which are to be used to fight evil. There is a Japanese mob and other villains who want to find a way to use their powers to rule the world.(insert evil laugh here).The story reads like a Scooby Doo mystery from that point on. Kenji is a secret agent and has a team of agents backing him, the entire climax of the story was filled with the team, including Kat, her uncle and a few other family members fighting scores of assassins and ending with ***SPOILER ALERT***  Kat and Kenji using their power to kill all of the assassins at once. Which begs the question, if it was that easy, why not do that in the first place.The villains are only described by their physical appearance throughout most of the book and only at the end are they named, not that we would have known them anyway since the book does not go into detail about them at all. There was a lot of description regarding what kinds or cars everyone was driving, what kinds of watches, earrings and shoes Kenji and his crew were wearing, all of which was unnecessary. The story was based in Atlanta and the Georgia mountains, which seemed odd for a Japanese ninja fight. Also the hero was described as being a traditional Japanese Samurai but several times said slang terms which seemed out of character. To the authors credit, she did have Kat to question him on it, but it was still out of place. There were more character inconsistancies I could name but this is already rather wordy and I think you get the point.There was a very obvious secondary romance thrown in as a set up for a sequel.

Naturally this book is described as Erotic Romance and those examples were not appropriate.First off, this book is not romantic and it certainly was not steamy.  I saw no romance in this book until the very last few pages.  Other than that, the hero was strictly Master and seemed to take pleasure in the punishment.  He was not protective of her in that he made her ""get into position"", and a position that was very revealing for all to see her finer qualities who might be visiting and were allowed to touch wherever they wished while he watched.  It reminded me of the Story of O.  The entire book was focused on one aspect of her anatomy, and I hint at it in the title of this Review. There was no pleasure to pull you into the book to feel what she felt and to go ""OMG"" at steamy scenes such as books from Vivien Sparx.I have read much better Master/Submissive books wherein the Master was kind and considerate and eventually one could see something growing between the two such as love.  These Masters did not like the idea of someone else looking at her finer qualities let alone touch.  When I see the word ""romance"", I expect to see exactly that and/or something growing between the hero and heroine as the two work together in that sort of relationship. I did not see this in this book.I forced myself to read to the end hoping that it would get better.  It only got worse and to me, degrading.

And in The Dickens With Love, Lanyon shines especially bright for adding a surprising amount of depth and backstory to the lead character, James Winter. Novella's are often hampered by their very nature, but in this, Lanyon rose above those limitations to provide an exceptionally well rounded character. His romantic lead, a Mr. Sedgwick Crisparkle, was perhaps NOT so fully defined and fleshed out, but was still superior to many two dimensional characters in novella-length stories.Add in a sweet holiday melancholy and yearnings for respectability once had and now lost and a measure of growth for James' character, and this lovely tale just shines like one of those starburst or starlight drinks Sedge favors so much. Which sounded delicious by the way...if a bit monsterously strong. The ""excerpts"" from the ""Christmas Cake"" were charming little surprises that lent an air of reality to the story as well. As I've said in a previous review of a novella-length Lanyon story, the only critique I truly have is that the romantic aspects of this m/m holiday romance don't quite touch me on as deep an emotional level as I'd hoped, but I still believe that's more due to the limiting nature of the length of the story than any failure on Lanyon's part. I admit...I'm cynical and don't believe in love developing within days or hours, so when the story spans such a time, it's hard for me to buy into a love-at-first-Dickens whirlwind romance.But top-notch storytelling, as always, for Lanyon.","03 10, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",1268179200

Seriously???The dialog was stiff and very simple.  It was connect-the-dots conversations.  B-O-R-I-N-G!We had an emotionally unstable/abusive hero.  Several times during the story he went from normal conversation to raging, (usually at our heroine) and back again in the space of moments all the while physically abusing our poor heroine.Our heroine was a rather simplistic person...and very flat emotionally...which was a good thing since she didn't seem to mind (or even notice) the abuse.The author couldn't keep track of her own plot.  First our hero knows all the heroine's secrets...she tells him point blank...and he doesn't care, he just loves our heroine! (ahh)  Then, he's stunned (and raging [Seeing a pattern?]) to learn those same secrets later in the book.Story/plot is jerky and doesn't flow, jumping from point to point.  I think we could see how much the author wrote in one day by the plot jumps, she seemed to loose track of where she was going halfway through a scene.I just couldn't get myself to care about any of the characters.  They are all so one dimensional and flat.  Their personalities, their conversations, their emotions (even when raging) were just so...flat.The author had no understanding about 1800's medical practices.  A *Duchess* going to the doctor's office(!?) and waiting in a waiting room(!?!) and then our hero in a rage (you MUST see the pattern by now!) and barging into the exam room(!?!?!).  [And unless the doctor is blind and deaf and the exam room is the size of a football stadium I can't believe he wouldn't notice the hero 'slamming and yelling' as he raged.]And, our villain. You could tell where the author was trying to go and the sense of dread she was trying to create...I just wish she would have followed through and delivered it...but alas, our villain was flat and unimaginative and...well stupid.  I kept expecting her to stomp her foot and hold her breath to get her own way.All in all, if this book hadn't been free I would have demanded my money back.  As it is, I wish I could demand my time back.  What I don't understand is the 4 and 5 star reviews.  This was so poorly written I can only implore the author to take a few English classes, take several writing classes, buy some good history books and learn how to plot out a book.

2495,B002SVQD0A,"[2, 5]",5,"I really like this book. Ms. Marinelli has a good ability to grasp her readers with just enough detail, not too much. This novel is a good glimpse of hope and second chances with one's spouse.  But, I have a couple of critiques.First of all, Ms. Marinelli seems to forget, like a lot of modern romance novelists, that her readers have an imagination of their own. It is my humble opinion that people who love to read are also very creative, imaginative and inventive.  As a result, they only need to be guided and engaged, but left to piece the obvious themselves.  I specifically refer to the scenes that only a spouse and a wife should be a part of. Its cliche and annoying to encounter the unnecessary descriptions of these scenes in a book such as this one.This book is really beautifully written and throwing in a piece of what Hollywood claims sells only cheapens things.  There is a beauty in leaving some things to the imagination.  I challenge Ms. Marinelli to be different.  She is an amazing writer.  I challenge her to believe in her skills as a writer and protest the status quo of cheap romance novels.Secondly, I also challenge her to look into a faith in God that she may be holding back.  It seems she was tempted to attribute the 'coincidental' occurences in the book to Him, but she held herself back by only saying 'someone' was looking out for the main characters.  Of the couple times that she mentions God by name, one is at a moment to blame Him for what 'went wrong' and another is to reduce Him to a buffet style God that one can pull apart for the pieces that are convenient to us.  And with this again, I challenge her to be different.Believe it or not, for as many people who read romance novels for the 'steamy' scenes, there are that many more who read them for hope in something more.  For some the belief that love is possible, for others that there is hope after difficulties and for others perhaps a good and clean escape.  Maybe your temptation to include God is not a mere coincidence as He does lead to good and hope filled love.I truly loved this book and only gave it one star away from perfect because I choose not to share it with others for the first reason I mentioned above.  I found myself having to skip those pages getting an idea of what was coming.  I do appreciate the warning at least.  But, call it pruddish or whatever else you may but I still believe in there being a lot more said when sometimes nothing is said at all but instead just understood.","08 21, 2012",A2J73AE2YSF332,Horselover,1345507200

Phil annoying Thom because he finds a fired-up Thom so sexy is just comical.

I've never read a book where I wanted it to end so badly. I finished ONLY because I like to finish books before I critique them.  I don't want to bash the author but I have to be honest here.The plot: Bride-to-be, Shanna finds out by supposed friend, LeToya, that her fiance, Kevin was kissing another man, Ben, on their wedding day.  Shanna runs out on the wedding and  decides to skip town by escaping to an Island where she meet top security guru Ross. They have a one-night stand ( and them some)  and Shanna begins to find contort in Ross. Later, Shanna returns home to find she is being stalked by a mystery person and starts receiving unknown phone calls as well as a robbery to one of her hair salons. She hires Ross to do some investigation and what they discover is a world of lies and betrayal by those who are closest to Shanna.My Take:This book for one, was horribly written. The plot had all the potential to be taken to the next level and failed... miserably. Granted, I understand this is an erotica book, but I was disturbed at how Shanna was able to find what the book described as ""passion"" in Ross not even knowing him for a day! For someone who just found out here fiance might be gay, she took it way to light for my liking.Aside from that, the plot ending up dying because they entire book was about Shanna and Ross having sex. I found myself skipping over several parts just to get back to the point of the story. Instead, of given details, readers are just told what happened. In all honestly, I would have rather had more details than all the sex. And BTW, the sex scene were't even good!!!! Double whammy!Overall I had more problems with the books then likes. Come to think of it, I can't say one thing I did like about the book. Not enough details, too predictable, plot that went south after page 1, and BAD SEX SCENES was just too much for me to bare.This was my first time I've read a book from this author and I'm almost inclined to say it will be my last. However, I like to give authors a couple of tries before I cut them off entirely. I will be skeptical however when I see other books by the author.

I normally dont like the BDMS thing, but when they are good they tend to be great. I did not feel this way about this book. The author takes the Dom/sub relationship way too far in this book, going into ""slave"" stuff. yuck yuck yuck.So basic plot line. Abused girl flees from an abusive jerk of a boyfriend, one who beats the crap out of her. She runs to the only safe place that she has ever known, her uncle's boat, only to discover two men living in a BDMS life and they have bought her uncle's boat. One man is an ex-cop, Sully. Clarisse doesn't trust him because he is a cop and the ""master"" in the relationship. and the other man, Mac, is the submissive. This is where I start to really dislike the book. Most of the BDMS books that I have read both men are productive in some kind of fulfilling life career. Not Mac. The whole ""slave"" thing really comes into play. All Mac does is clean the house and have sex. that's it. The men bring Clarisse into their home so that she can recover, saying that she doesnt have to participate. What??? If i was invited to someone's house after having the crap kicked out of me by a boyfriend and agreed why would you tell someone about your sex life. That would make me run in the opposite direction not toward it. it was really weird. Then as she grows to love the men, the men grow fond of her. Mac tells Sully he love Clarisse but will never leave Sully for her. Sully doesnt really admit his feelings at this time.It is kind of like Mac wants a pet of his own. So Mac tells Clarisse he loves her, but it is not really a full love because he belongs to Sully and will only ever belong to him. Sully will be the one to marry her but she is not at the same rank as Mac and if it came down to a choice Mac would win. I was more then frustrated. The men want her but I never really felt like they loved her. She really struggles with the D/s thing. I felt as though the men never really cared. They want to convince Clarisse that Dom/sub life is more then it seems but if she cant except it take a hike. But when she cant they want her to stay. To say I was confused is an understatement. So Clarisse is invited to several D/s parties, she grows to understand and except the lifestyle they are in. But she still doesn't belong to the men fully. Sully says no sex until they are married. But the weird thing is Sully and Mac did it all the time before they were truly committed with one another. Clarisse agrees to marry Sully, for the life of me i dont understand. He had not said he loved her at this point in the book. She just doesnt want to be alone, away from Mac. But Mac only kind of loves her. stupid.So after all the conflict and drama in the book's surrounding plot line (with the exboyfriend) she marries Sully. She wears both his and Mac's rings on her finger. Sully wears Mac's ring and Mac wears Sully's ring. The author makes a point to tell you this because even though Clarisse loves both men both men only really claim eachother.SO after saying all of that... I was down right annoyed with this book. YUCK!!! BDMS can be good. But when you dont have an equal relationship between the partners it is crap. I really wanted Clarisse to heal and then move out of their house. Mac for the most part only calls Sully ""master"" and then when she gets sucked into their lifestyle she does the same. Sully is the only one working and making money. Clarisse is the thirdwheel in this relationship. I hated that.I have read other books by Tymber Dalton/Macy Largo and they have been good. Sunset Hearts for example is wonderful.My advice dont waste your money.","02 18, 2011",A36KEQ5JF2UTE7,Jennifer Brown,1297987200

11983,B001CNR8HM,"[10, 10]",5,"If Terry Pratchett's Samuel Vimes and Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade ever had a love child, he would be finder Markhat. Sardonic, embittered, suspicious, but at heart a gentleman and an honorable ex-soldier, he expects the worst from everyone and brings out the best in many.Tuttle's world is very reminiscent of Terry Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork. Very reminiscent - to the point where it bothered me quite a bit. Not only is there the same mix of fantasy and urban reality, you have Trolls playing a very large part in the story - and they're identical to Pratchett's trolls. Even the opening reminds one of the start of 'Guards, Guards'. The character names are very similar, as are the details of shops and the city and the river. Not identical, mind you, just a bit too close an imitation at times. As 'Dead Man's Rain, progresses, however, it finds its own unique voice and setting, and I stopped thinking this was Pratchett noir.'Dead Man's Rain' is a horror story and a narrative about venal instincts, greed and guilt. The set up is a little Maltese Falconish, and Markhat's weary cynicism is pure Spade as he deals with the snobby Widow Merlat and a incredible tales of ghosts and hauntings. But then, just as Tuttle sets you up thinking the plot will be resolved one way, he takes you down another. We learn more about Merlat's family, and her, and her servants, and Markhat reveals the qualities that kept him alive through a bitter and destructive war, in order to save the good and punish the wicked. This is not a romance - there's no pairing in this at all - and that's how it should be for our tarnished hero.Tuttle's writing is delightful, and even if he's borrowed some settings a little too heavily, Markhat's his own memorable creation, as are the plots and the dialogue. He's funny, in a very Bogartian sort of way, but like Pratchett, there's a deeper thread to his narrative than simple humour, with many a wry observation on human and non-human behaviour, populating his stories with vivid characters who continually surprise the reader.Really, there's nothing not to like here, if you like this genre, and aren't put off by the lack of romance. Finder Markhat is someone I want to read more about, and I hope Mr Tuttle revisits him.","06 16, 2009",A31LB0DBMZJT72,"Ann Somerville ""Love, romance, and the occasi...",1245110400

The couple bond as Kent tries to keep Povre out of the clutches of government agents while hoping that her people manage to rescue her.  The action is deftly split between scenes of on Earth, and aboard the ship that brought Povre to Earth.  The characters are well written and believable with the relationships between them ringing true.  While the story may seem cliche (alien on Earth needs rescuing from the big bad government agency), T.M. makes it fresh and takes it in interesting directions.  She has a nice turn of phrase and writes in an enjoyable style.  The rescue of Povre has a bit of a Deus Ex Machina feel, but that's a slight quibble, as she does set it up better than most.

2822,B001892DGG,"[2, 2]",5,"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a shifter-focused paranormal romance with Pumas. Writing is light and fun. Characters are not very deep, but still appealing. Magic is understated with the emphasis on the dual nature of the shifters and the significance of finding a mate. This is a fast read- what you see is what you get. Nothing too intense.PLOT: Very basic. This is a subgenre that traditionally doesn't have complicated plotlines and this one doesn't stray far from the norm. Still, it does what it is supposed to. This is a NOVELLA, so be prepared for things to move a little faster than is reasonable. There isn't much adjustment time for Max to court Emma, Emma to accept the idea of shifters and becoming one and the plot to resolve itself. It would have been better if there was more to it. One complaint, the ""claiming"" was completely unreasonable in its suddenness and lack of explanation- and then the response was disproportionately low.CHARACTERS: Like watching an episode of ""Friends,"" this story presents a few fun personalities with a little history and plenty of potential for ongoing mischief. Max seems like a genuinely nice, well rounded guy, if a little self-centered. Emma is a spunky, full-figured chick. Her virgin state was a little too far-fetched for me and, frankly, I'm getting a little annoyed with the prevalence of this particular point in para-romance. Maybe there are more virgins out there than I thought...BOTTOM LINE: This is perfect if you are in the mood for a little shifter fun. Not too heavy, no real violence, a little lust, a little humor.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series2.

It's bad enough so many of my lesfic publishers put pictures of trees and hospitals on the covers and are afraid of getting too sexy... but these publishers who cater to the f/f pool of readers (mostly men, I gather) are afraid of putting butches on the cover.  Or they SERIOUSLY never look like the leads inside.  Or it looks like the cover of Penthouse.  Is there no honesty or a happy medium???  pfft.Okay.  Got that off my chest.  I like Paisley Smith but I never bothered ever reading the synopsis of this one due to the cover until I got REALLY interested in her work, lol.  Glad I did.  This is definitely one of my favorite Paisley couples.  (And no, I don't blame writers for what ends up on their covers)In this one we meet an early 20something boyish lesbian in boots and jeans....  who falls for her very mature and widowed 30something piano teacher.  Emily Granger is beautiful, wealthy, and blonde.  I love the classy way she is described and the fact that she hasn't been sexually fulfilled before.  Love an author who doesn't forget to give me a visual of her lovely legs.  Or her lovely skirt.  Or the way her hair falls about her shoulders.  I love these visuals.  Emily's femininity emanates right off the page... my favorite thing about Paisley's femmes.  They are genuinely feminine and delicate... and just passive enough to create a very delicious dynamic with a butch who knows how to take control.I can't get enough of her butch / femme couples when they are like these two.  It's what I liked about Beguiled.  And Beauty and the Butch.  Unfortunately, it's not a long story and won't take more than an hour to read at 50ish pages.  Even so, I'd of probably rated it 4 stars if the stupid drunken brother-in-law hadn't cut in on this story with the lame conflict.  The last bit of the story was... meh.

I'm not sure why this butch didn't show up packing to those lustful piano lessons at LEAST once... that no-harness dildo scene just didn't cut it, Paisley.  The butch shoulda been packing!!!!. lol.

Generous, lusty, fun, varied. No bdsm, toys or any other accessories. A different take on the m/m - they are cowboys who spend long winters together and don't mind helping each other out. But never saw themselves as a committed couple. While we start out as a fun menage for a few days, we end up aiming for a committed threesome.Opinion:Erotic contemporary cowboy menage with lots of revenge sex and a nice HEA. This is a nice little book but it isn't anything spectacular. It is disappointingly short, but it is complete. Nothing is left to be said. All plot strands are wound up. I like the ending, I like that Kate is given the opportunity to make an intelligent, considered decision (so unusual in these books!) and I like that it is simply a Naughty Weekend that just maybe takes us to Forever. There are no Bad Guys, no-one is Wounded, no Angst. We simply get lots of sex and then a HEA (with more sex *grin*). It is what it is.Aside:The m/m instance is a little more uncomfortable than I expected. I have read m/m where they are committed and ready and willing to go for it when the opportunity arises. It is natural. I have read m/m where at a point during the menage a decision is made to test the waters and hey! look at that! we like it. It's organic. But ""Saddled"" is a little different. More forced. The men aren't so willing to go down that path with Kate there (although they have in private). And the issue is somewhat taken out of their hands by the games they are playing. It changes the dynamic. No one is ""forced"" but IMO it gets a little grey and drops this from a low 4 stars to a high 3.-CR-","09 3, 2011",A1ZN2JLLR9GI3T,cathyr,1315008000

Given the subject matter and the fact that I'm a fan of historical fiction (Follett, Kalogridis) I tore into Children of Salem shortly after downloading it.I was disappointed.I won't to into too much detail about the plot.  Jeremy Wakely is sent from Boston to look into the questionable practices of a puritan minister in Salem, Mass. Jeremy has a history in Salem and is reluctant to go back but he does so out of honor...and because of a girl.  Jeremy is thrust neck deep into the mystery and lunacy that was the Salem Witch Trials of the late 17th century.The Salem Witch Trials was one of the darkest and most interesting periods in American history.  With that as a backdrop, I was very much looking forward to tearing my way through this book.It's not that Walker's a bad writer.  The historical aspects are well covered and he does give the reader a good sense of how it was for people living in that area of the country at that time in history.No, the main problem with this book is the pacing.  It's S-L-O-W.  It says it's a little over 400 pages but it certainly feels longer than that.  The book is filled with frequent drawn out conversations where the participants seem to be reiterating the same things over and over again.  Frankly, it spoiled my enjoyment of the book.I'm not an instant gratification type of reader.  I don't mind a nice build up to a big reveal or a good ending but sometimes I felt it was a chore to get through the conversations to see what the next development in the story was.The love angle between Jeremy and Serena didn't seem to 'pop', that's the best way I can think to describe it.  I think it's partially because many of the characters just seemed to read the same way.  With a few standouts, most of the characters seemed to speak the same exact way and had the same type of personalities.I don't mean to bash it.  I'm sure this novel couldn't have been easy to write, especially considering the historical aspect of it.

The book is in two parts, the first is narrated by Gabriel Sandalini, an undercover cop who's young and restless. When the narration switches to Miguel Ortega, there is more than a change in the point-of-view, because we find out that Miguel Ortega is in fact Antonio Lorenzo, an FBI undercover agent.The first part has the same pace of Gabriel's personality: fast, dangerous, with little time to ponder. The second part mirrors Antonio's more reflective and patient attitude. In the first part we see how the two protagonists meet and how strong their attraction is; the second part shows how they stay together, how the attraction turns to love.I loved both Gabriel and Antonio and at the end of the book I think that both retained their mystery. We have glimpses of their past, but we never know how they came to be the men they are and what they bring into their relationship except for their attitudes toward life in general. While Gabriel seems to realize that he needs Antonio, his help and his dominance, as if Antonio were the only one who could contain is energy and heal his hurt, Antonio seems the one who is able to see inside Gabriel and pours his love onto the young and injured man, fulfilling his own need to love. The two complete each other on every level and in every aspect of their life.And it broke my heart, but I appreciated that the authors didn't choose the easy way of making Gabriel's injury temporary. It was bitter and it was better that we saw it through Antonio's eyes, because I am sure it would have been painful to know what Gabriel's thoughts were, but we got to see how Antonio reached out to him, enduring the bouts of anger and despair of his lover.I don't know if I'd like to know more about them, I must confess that for me the story is told, but if the sequel is written, I will surely read it.","02 14, 2011",A1RXR105ND8OSH,manutwo,1297641600

The story line is a good one but needs to be developed more. Some reviews were complaining about the link between rider, dragon and sex. If anyone who has read the"" Dragonriders of Pern"" series would know this has already been established in Dragon fantasy lore. However where as the Pern series down plays the sexual side of the relationships Maiden Flight is in your face erotica. I do agree there needs to be a warning that this is an ADULT dragon fantasy novel  and not for young adults.  The series has great promise and I'm hoping that the next book goes more into the story line with a little sex thrown it ;)","06 23, 2013",A24DZ4G5PKWFLN,trekker,1371945600
1822,B003YH9LP6,"[0, 0]",5,"This collection of short stories contains five short mystery/revenge tales and a preview of another full novel from the author.  The first story shares the title of the collection and focuses on two detectives having lunch while discussing a current case.  It's a good start to the collection as it's well-written, well-paced, and has a satisfying end result.  Following that, however, are stories which go a bit down hill in quality.  The next two stories (""The Hoosegow Strangler"" and ""Trail of the Lonesome Stickpin"") feature the author's Old West husband/wife duo of Mick and Casey.  They both read as young adult fiction, which contrasts starkly with the first story in the collection, and don't really do a good job of introducing the characters or making the reader care about them.  The second of these (Lonesome Stickpin) is a bit of a mess in terms of pacing and narration -- there are parts of the story that are simply difficult to follow and the storyline isn't interesting enough to justify re-reading sections to follow the specifics.  While the first three stories are more closely aligned with the mystery genre, the final two are tales of revenge.  The fourth story (""Alibi"") makes another stark transition to a modern tale of a planned homicide.  Although somewhat interesting, it's a very quick tale that likely could have been better fleshed out.  The final story (""The Promise"") transitions back to the Old West and features a story about a dysfunctional family.  Overall, i would give it two stars.  The major upside is the quality of the first story.  The collection was freebie when I got it and was worth downloading for the title story -- the rest could be easily skipped.","01 24, 2013",A2EECVV4L82JJE,Zagain,1358985600

Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn that he may lose him. To Gregory Ryland has always been special but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him. Ryland is a Tri-Omega and has to have two mates to keep him balanced and safe and he has to be claimed by both mates daily or he will die. So now that Gregory has claimed him, they have a limited amount of time to locate Ryland other mate. Enter Viktor Beta of another pack that Gregory and Ryland meet while on vacation. Viktor isn't so sure about this whole Tri-Omega thing and he's positive he doesn't want to have to share his mate. This book cleverly overlaps in time with the first book Secret Desires showing the same scenes but with a different perspective. I love this series it as some very hot sex scenes I mean three hot guys sexing is oh so hot. This book had a few misunderstanding and the lack of communication due in part to Gregory and Viktor not wanting to share and the fact that they are attracted to each other and them not understanding that they all have to come together as one.

Well.... I can probably sum up my review in this one sentence: I devoured this book!It's short but for the few hours you get to read it there's a lot of heavy breathing and your heart will definitely be through the roof.  It was kind of funny that at certain times I was checking to make sure nobody around me was looking at my tablet screen.  And then I couldn't put it down and had to sneak a few lines while I was driving.Duke and Maverick are roommates.  They are also in the soccer team together.  They are best friends and throughout the four years they've lived together they've become really close.  Except now they are about to get a whole lot closer.This story is told only from Mav's point of view and he's dealing with being attracted to Duke.  Duke doesn't make things easier as he is always being very close and physical and then there's the games of gay chicken...and extremely gay chicken.  When they are coming up short to pay their last month of rent they end up posing for some se xy pictures for the Str8te Boys website.  And things just escalate from there.This story was fun and sexy.  It's a story of discovery and of dealing with emotions and attraction.

11333,B0043M4RTQ,"[7, 7]",5,"As an avid lover of fairytales revamped for adults, I literally devoured ""Mrs. Beast"" in one sitting. I began reading it around 10p.m. and I stayed up until about 2 a.m. It was that good. I loved how Elora had her finger in every fairytale ""pie"" and her interactions with her poor, mistreated mutt.The sequel starts out strong, but as soon as the protagonist, Rune (the daughter of Beauty and the Beast) goes on a quest to find the Hedgehog turned Prince that she is infatuated with, the story rapidly begins to lose steam. I think the problem is Ms. Ditchoff used and elaborated on the backstory of so many better known, more interesting fairytale characters all the well known, more interesting fairytale heroines in her first book, leaving her to really scrape for more to use in this one and the characters are, for lack of a better word, lame and completely one-dimensional. Or perhaps she was rushed when she wrote the sequel and was not able to take the same amount of time and care she put into the first to really expand upon her characters.I found myself unable to connect or really care about Rune or all the characters in the story the way I did when I read Mrs. Beast. Plus, the characters who share their tales are so unfamilar to me, that I felt kind of lost and my interest wanned.For example, Rune meets the Bog King's daughter who takes FOREVER to tell her boring story which could have been summed up in a paragraph. Basically this is her backstory: Mom is raped by the Bog King, daughter is born and turns into a 80lb frog each night(sounds like Fiona from Shrek...). Priest comes to village, then Bog daughter escapes to Egypt with Mom, turns back into a princess, then goes to Heaven with the Priest, returns to earth and finds that 100 years have passed, so now she is a bolt of lightening for all eternity that works for Elora. Um...yeah...okay...Elora is a lot more subdued in the story and her interactions with her mutt don't sizzle with the same humor and irony. I forced myself to continue reading, but it was unenjoyable and a big let down.Because of the strength of Mrs. Beast, I would be willing to give a third book by Ms. Ditchoff a try, but if it dissapoints me as much as Princess Beast, then I won't be purchasing anymore.","11 14, 2010",A1UF7LO7RDMU77,The_Hmm_Girl,1289692800

Some academic somewhere has probably written a paper on the subject. My hunch is that it's related deep down to a desire for happy endings, common in we humans. As a skeptical guy who has a handle on reality (I like to think so) I've never read much fantasy - although I do like the Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter movies, which is something of a contradiction I suppose (like the man who reads Playboy for the articles I watch fantasy movies for the special effects). If you're like me and you're searching for an introduction to a genre that you might have previously avoided, you could do a lot worse than read these stories. The secret is to suspend disbelief and go with the flow. Don't allow logic or reason to interfere. These fantasies do what they need to do: ensure that good triumphs over evil, that magic wins out in the end, that friends and family are important, and that endings are always happy (well, happy-ish anyway). Along the way, you might even learn a thing or two about herbs.","04 4, 2010",AAG042SY4O0CH,B. A. Wallace,1270339200

Alex Faustin is far from crazy.  He's a vampire who's just traveled all the way from his luxurious NYC life to the wilds of Colorado for his mate.  It's a race against time to convince her to be his forever, while finding shelter and evading the law.  When a horrible incident reveals his secret, Helena learns he is a creature of darkness.How will she reconcile her feelings for a man who is monster?Admittedly, I had mixed feelings about Called by Blood.  I was not sure if I liked Helena and Alex because they sometimes came off as immature in their reactions and interactions to various situations they were forced to overcome and deal with.  It's been noted that love often makes people reckless.  Perhaps it was Helena's emotional baggage and Alex's spoiled haphazard bungling that that kept me off kilter.  I'm not certain.  All I know is that I really became interested in some of the secondary characters that appeared.  *Shrug* It happens sometimes.The writing style was very contemporary which mostly didn't work for me in the narrative along with the large doses of saccharine romance.  Also, the sweetness seemed at odds with the down and dirty sex.  Overall, it was a pretty decent novel, with harrowing moments and plot twists that kept me reading.  The best compliment I can offer is that I'm willing to reread this story again.  There are a lot of things about it to like and in all fairness, I've been reading lots of vampire fiction back to back, so my expectations differ from book to book.  I'm rather biased against treating vampires in the traditional manner and really get into books where vampirism `evolves' beyond the usual limitations.  This may have colored my initial response to Alex and the hardships he faces with Helena.  Still, I'm also the first to admit that it was used constructively as an effective plot device, and that's worth a bright gold star instead of a wooden stake.Patrice F.","02 3, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1265155200

She wakes up in a motel room the next day with a concussion.  Mac is with her.  He was recently hired to work with her on the horse farm.  Together they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about it.  Maris has no memory of what she was doing before she was injured.  Maris realizes she is attracted to Mac.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was about half the length of a typical romance novel.  It was a ""falling in lust"" story.  There was no time for any relationship development.  It was shallow.  I wanted more intrique, unique characters, and more interesting plot and dialogue.  But if you loved the series, you might like this out of curiosity.After the mystery and danger is over, a chunk of time is spent with Maris' family in Wyoming.  There is the cute little toddler, all the hunky men, their wives and children.  Everyone is loving and protective.  It was a pleasant time.OTHER BOOKS:There are five Mackenzie books.  The first three were much better than books 4 and 5.  This is book 4.  For a list of my reviews of all five books, see my 5 star review of Burn posted 7-11-09.CAUTION SPOILER:I didn't understand the scene in which Maris was hit in the head (which was told and not shown).  Apparently the bad guy was starting to inject the horse when Maris arrived.  He hits her in the head causing a concussion, but she is able to get on the horse and ride away.  Can one be concussed and still mount and ride?  Why couldn't the bad guy finish the injection as she was mounting?  I wanted more details and showing, not telling.DATA:Kindle count story length: 1462.  Swearing language: mild.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 1, about a page long.

I also loved the half and half viewpoints, I loved the two leads (and I loved the layout of the book, how you learn each character truly in turn, and then can think back and know more of their emotions from earlier scenes).

Readers of a sensitive nature need to be aware that this short story deals with the topic of assisted suicide and contains profanity and some sex.This novella is a very well researched and altogether thought-provoking commentary on end of life issues, euthanasia, and the uncertainties inherent in research on the brain and death. It touches on issues that many readers, may or may not have had personal experience of particularly in this day and age where people are able to be kept alive long after they should've been let go, by medical research and already in situ practices.The characters are developed extremely well, with the male lead adding heavily to the overall success of this little read. If the energies the Author had put into developing the characters been directed elsewhere, not only would they have become two-dimensional and uninteresting it would have affected the plot as a whole. The characters different points of view and thoughts on the topic covered are well researched and make this short story seem as if it is a full length book.There were two things that bothered me though about this novella; one was the relationships formed between the male lead and the two diametrically opposite females, but then again who can fully explains the laws of attraction and there is the old saying `there are two types of women, those you take home to Mum, and those you don't', which put to rest any damage these relationships may have done to my enjoyment of this read. Another niggle were the proofreading errors, which normally really spoil a read for me; in this case that was not to be. Yes, there were typos, but they were so easily discerned and non-intrusive that it did nothing to detract from the overall enjoyment of the short.The book finishes with a lot of loose ends, rather like life actually and, although I was initially surprised by the very abrupt ending, I decided that not only did it work well but suited the book, and what there is of the book has stayed with me for a long time after I finished reading.I would recommend this to book to anyone who would like a good quick read that will make them think.

Right from the beginning, I could see how well-put together this story is, lots of descriptive detail, dynamic character and easy dialogue. I love short stories, and it's not that easy to take short fiction and pack it with substance and intrigue. This story is short but layered; there's some darkness to it, some magic and fantasy, and some seduction and scheming.The story is told in first-person from the POV of Sir Dardanus, but what makes that unique for me is that he's really an anti-hero, ""a bastard and ne'er-do-well, a murderer and a seducer of women."" Just what won't this man do in order to get what he desires? Even at the end, I was still a bit uncertain about what he'd actually do, and with the way the author left the final page, I have to wonder how or if this romance will continue. I choose to see hope and promise there, mixed with the darkness.This isn't a sweet, happy romance, Dardanus and his intentions a little too dark and moody for that. Also, I wouldn't say that this story is overly erotic (and I do think it needed to be more erotic in that detail), but certain aspects of the story do hold some sex appeal for me: the domination and surrender, the dark and complex hero, even the slightly rough sex scene and the tension behind it. Combined with the author's skill, all of those things produce an engaging short read and a hero who knows how to leave his mark.

6462,B0031568J8,"[5, 5]",5,"This decently entertaining short novel is the first installment of Guido Henkel's supernatural adventure series starring his Jason Dark, Ghost Hunter creation.  Though the writing in this self-published offering is sometimes a little repetitive and clunky, it never sinks to sloppy or slapdash levels.  Besides, the scene setting and descriptions of Victorian London more than compensate: both aspects are moody and effective, nicely drawing the reader into Henkel's world of demons and supernatural investigation.My other criticisms are basically quibbles. I would have liked to see more dialogue between Dark and his supporting cast members; it would have enabled us to get to know everyone a little better, as well as break up the large blocks of dense description (usually of streets and buildings) in the prose.  Also, an occasional plot twist or dramatic revelation would have punched things up a little, especially at the end, where all we get is a long fight scene (though not a bad one).  But, again, I liked the moody, creepy vibe Henkel delivers throughout, and more importantly, I cared about Jason Dark and the people around him.From reading Mr. Henkel's book description here on Amazon (as well as his recent blog postings), I learned that I apparently just missed a revised version of ""Demon's Night"", which includes a new cover, a lower price, and a polishing of the prose.  So the most recent version of this book might be better than I'm giving it credit for here.  It's certainly cheaper.Will I come back for more?  Sure.  While perhaps lacking the crispness and total polish of a novel one might pick up at your local book store, the sudden availability of interesting self-published offerings like Guido Henkel's Jason Dark books on the Kindle more than compensates for any slight shortcomings in the final product, at least in this case.And, as we all well know, it's not like ""officially"" published books are perfect, either.","03 10, 2011",A3GRN6J64F2C3X,"Joseph P.

I am giving this 3 stars because I didn't find anything truly outstanding about this book.Most of the stort stories are in a first-person point-of-view, as told by Adam.  However, there are a few that are not and I found that confusing.  Also, there is one story (Michigan) in which the narrator refers to himself as Noah.  Who is Noah?  Later in another story, when Adam speaks of losing his grandmother, I can only assume that it was Adam at the hosptial/nursing home.  Why he said his name was Noah, I still do not know.The final issue I have with the book is that some of the sentences I had to read over and over again.  They were phrased so strangely that they barely made sense.  I could have though of many other ways to have written those sentences and I am by no means a writer.The collection of stories all and all were good, not great.

I really wanted to know more about the characters...except ""Bella"".  I love strong, capable female characters, but she was only good on a bike and with weapons.  I did not understand Jack's undying love, as I thought she had all the appeal of a wet marshmallow.  She was such a hot mess, under  that tough exterior, that I almost quit reading.  And the constant, never ending misuse of ""phase"" for ""faze"" was incredibly irritating. I'm not a grammar freak, typos don't faze me...but this constant usage of phase, or phased, was seriously starting to bother me. I would expect someone who wrote this many books to know the difference.  And every hot guy looks, and sounds, like a movie star?  Seriously?  Bella kind of redeemed herself at the end, enough that I would have bought a sequel had it been available.

4841,B002AJ7X2C,"[0, 1]",5,"Ya know, I really have to quit falling for the marketing gimmicks being used with books like this. I was getting bogged down in a history book and was looking for something quick and easy to read as a sort of mental palette-cleanser before jumping back into the second half of a rather long history book. Viola! There was Serial, a quick-read about a killer who preys on hitchhikers and a hitchhiking killer who preys on drivers and the mayhem that ensues when this unlikely pair meet. Toss in some hype about how each of the authors wrote a chapter featuring one of the serial killers, then collaborated on the final chapter in which the killers meet and it sounded like it might be a promising story. So I downloaded it. After reading the story in about 20 minutes I can definitely say this is a book that was worth every cent I paid for it.I guess I shouldn't complain because it was free ... but even so, I got the feeling that Serial was less about a unique collaboration between two action/horror/thriller authors wishing to share their experimental fiction with readers than writers finding a new way to foist rejected first drafts on readers. Other than the authors competing to see who can come up with the most gross-out scene, there's not really much to recommend the story. Don't expect any character development or insight ... just prepare for a story that could have easily been told with sound effects: Screech, thud, smash, scream followed by slurp, clang, thump, bump, scream. If you like your reading to be all action and no introspection, then by all means go for it.Oh, and as a postscript, I notice that Amazon is now selling an ""extended version"" of Serial. That's a $2.99 I think I'll keep in my pocket.","12 27, 2010",A38Q3T99Z5X2LX,W. V. Buckley,1293408000

As a diversion, Jonas Maxim suggests they each reveal their most daring sexual exploits.  After all, they are men and sex is one of their favorite subjects.  The Earl of Grayson requests the opportunity to be the first to share his tale...Robert St. Claire, Earl of Grayson is stunned with the Sultan's gift of a beautiful slave to see to his carnal needs during his visit.  He's not exactly comfortable with this unorthadox practice.  To further complicate matters, Robert learns that the woman meant for his pleasure is no ordinary slave girl.  She's English and the daughter of a friend.  If he has any chance of freeing her, he'll have to avail himself of her many charms and pray that the Sultan will allow him to take her with him when the time comes for him to leave.Lady Celia Davenport had been the belle of London society.  Then she was abducted, sold into slavery, and expected to pleasure a guest of the Sultan's is most overwhelming to her gentle breeding.  When she discovers that the man she is to service is English and knows her father, she is great relief.  She now has a smidgen of hope of being able to return home but only if she is submissive to Robert's desires and pleases him. Otherwise she may be lost to the harem for the rest of her life.Each night Celia is brought to Robert's room where they share a bed and indulge their growing passion for each other.  Neither of them is able to speak freely because they are watched through carefully constructed peep holes in the wall - in this manner the Sultan can be assured that indeed his guest is pleased with his generosity.  If she doesn't please him, she will immediately be punished and replaced.Fortunately Robert is a very skilled lover and goes out of his way to ensure that Celia enjoys each of their sessions just as much as he does.  After their first night together, the Sultan gifts Celia with four perfect pearls - one for each time the esteemed guest found satisfaction inside her body.  Over the two weeks that Robert is a guest, his feelings for Celia grow while he worries about the future. Will he be able to successfully rescue her from a lifetime of slavery in the harem?  If so, how is he going to explain all this to her father?Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB series is off to a brilliant start with this gem of a tale.  ARABIAN PEARL satisfies that wicked fantasy that many women have of being kidnaped and thrust into the life of a harem girl while still retaining a sense of independence and a hope for freedom.  I love how Celia changes throughout the storyline - she goes from a shy virgin to a self confident young woman who rejoices in her own sexuality.  Robert's blatant adoration of Celia really endears him to me.ARABIAN PEARL captured my interest from the very first page and held me enthralled right to the end.

Eventually, their characters sorted themselves out.The girls are self-reliant, thrown on their own devices with a new infant sister after their mother dies in childbirth. These are not the kick-butt women of adult urban fantasy, but gentler young women who rely on wisdom and cunning rather than on tough talk and gun or sword play. At one point, some of the sisters sacrifice their long hair to help nearby villagers in the non-magical reality. In other words, the Byrne sisters set good examples as females with inner strength, intelligence, resourcefulness, and compassion.In the tradition of classic fairy tales, their aunt turns out to be a black magic evil-doer. But they also have protective adults in their lives -- a close friend of their mother who becomes a mentor in magic and a mysterious gentleman from the Far East who comes bearing gifts and wisdom.As a series, this work has a lot of potential. There are, after all, the lives of seven protagonists to explore.I enjoyed this book, a free Kindle download, even though I am a senior citizen. I doubt that I will continue to read additional installments. But this is just the sort of book that delighted me as a young adult.

The resulting levels range from uninhabited Earths to Earths with high space-faring civilizations. And one of those Earths discovered how to travel between these worlds.Of course a paratime traveling civilization opens the possibility of all sorts of mischief and requires a police force. Since the Original Time Line has exhausted its resources, it needs paratime travel to obtain the resources it requires to continue to exist. It's the job of the Paratime Police to keep order among the paratimers and to keep the Paratime Secret at all costs.These stories are built around the career of Verkan Val, paratime policeman extraordinary, and his efforts to help his culture keep the Paratime Secret. It's not an easy job. In the course of these stories Val has to recover a Venusian Night Hound that has been let loose on our timeline (late-40's Pennsylvania to be exact), get his sometime-wife Dalla off a world where reincarnation is scientifically proven fact before she overturns the entire civilization, and battle a gang of trans time slavers whose roots reach into the very heart of the Original Time Line government itself.Most of these stories originally appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the late 40s and 50s. Like most Astounding offerings, they're full of high action against well-thought-out backgrounds and spiced with interesting characters. It makes for a colorful offering.Although Piper had been writing science fiction for more than 15 years, he didn't attract real notice until his last Paratime story, Lord Kalvin of Otherwhen, and the unrelated Little Fuzzy. Unfortunately, depressed by financial troubles, he committed suicide just as his career was taking off. It's good to have this collection to help remember H.

They arrange a dance and invite people from neighboring cities to attend hoping the restless males will find mates and perhaps settle down.When Emily hears about the dance she decides it's just the thing she needs.  6 months prior, her cheating husband left her for another woman and was killed the same day.  Talk about Karma.  Tired of the living the lie that her husband was a good man and she had a perfect life, she is ready to let loose and experience a night of passion, no strings attached.Saber Mitchell is determined to find mates for his 4 rowdy younger brothers.  After years of dating and searching for his mate, he's come to the conclusion that it's not meant to be for him, but that doesn't stop him from insisting he and his brothers attend that dance in search of mates for them.When Sabre meets Emily the physical attraction is immediate and mutual. The two of them share a night of passion, first outside the dance in the dark and later at Saber's home.  This is uncharacteristic behavior for Emily but she goes with it finding herself drawn to Saber but with a few reservations. Saber recognizes Emily as his mate and must figure out how to win her love, gain her trust and reveal his were-cat nature.Scarlet Woman is a very sexy read.  I felt that Emily and Saber lacked a little heat in the very beginning though.  I didn't pick up the chemistry or immediate attraction they felt that lead to the intimacy they shared early on. However as their relationship developed they certainly warmed things up both physically and emotionally drawing me in and  they had me rooting for their happily ever after.This book focused mostly on the development of the relationship between Saber and Emily.  I really thought at some point there would be a dangerous conflict or something besides Emily's reluctance to commit to a relationship that would cause dissension but it never came about. There was a reporter nosing around the town investigating sightings of black panthers which became an annoyance for the couple, but there never really was a conflict from that angle which was surprising to me.Saber's brothers were very mischievous with a side of super sexy.  They provided some nice comic relief among the romance and I look forward to reading their stories as well.  The twins, in particular, got my attention with their fun loving attitude.Overall, I enjoyed this paranormal romance and look forward to reading more of the Middlemarch March series.","03 8, 2010",A22IG8DQO4WKS8,"Fiction Vixen ""Fiction Vixen Book Reviews""",1268006400

7314,B00413PT9Y,"[4, 6]",5,"I read both of the existing reviews before purchasing this book, and also read a bit of the sample.  The sample sold me, and I decided to plunk down the money and take a chance.  I probably should have listened to the 3-star reviewer...  In the end, the story really was not even a three-star, hence my rating, as well.First off, yes, I was fascinated by Cavan's background.  His pain was my pain.  But I felt as though the character of the dom, Biton, fell flat, and the story felt rushed, especially the ending.  More importantly, I felt as though the short-shrift given to Cavan's recovery (which I'll go into a bit more detail about below) did a disservice to the plight of abused and neglected children in general.  Sorry about the high-horse here, but my livelihood is inextricably intertwined with child abuse/neglect and the law, so I'm probably overly sensitive to the issue.MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW:Biton is a high-powered attorney who is gay and into the BDSM lifestyle.  He has just lost his longtime love and sub of 10 years, Erik, and is in mourning.  He's lonely enough that he enters into a short, 30-day ""contract"" with Cavan, an abused (tortured, literally) young man who is lost/floundering when he is rescued from his former ""master.""  Biton feels for Cavan, and is also very attracted to him.  But when he realizes what Cavan has been through, he takes Cavan's recovery on as a single-minded mission.Great setup, definitely.  But a story like this, that revolves around serious issues of child physical and sexual abuse needs more care, in my opinion.  The depth of writing was simply lacking.  Maybe it's just that the subject matter was better suited to something other than erotica (where sex between the characters is de riguer).True, Biton wants to do the right thing by Cavan, which is admirable.  But Cavan's therapist tells Biton not to have sexual relations with the young man until he is ""healed.""  And yet, after 3 weeks of therapy (yes, three weeks!), they are doing the deed again.  And not just having sex, either, but with restraints and whips!  No therapist okay or anything.  I have a little experience with the ramifications of child abuse and neglect in both my personal and professional lives.  There is no way that 3 weeks is enough to ""recover"" from what this man went through as a child.  That part made me cringe.  I wanted to shoot Biton, not hug him for going to bat for Cavan!Beyond that criticism, the entire recovery (3 weeks worth) was just sort of glossed over.  Then we have one sex scene and -boom - the book is over.  From what I read in another review, there is apparently a sequel.  I don't think I'll be buying it, much as I'd love to know what happens in the long run.I am sure Ms. Kersten really believed she was doing right by her characters and even for the cause of child abuse, but I think she really bit off more than she could chew with this depth of abuse.  A part of me just couldn't imagine poor Cavan could EVER consent to BDSM after what he had been through, and the fact that Biton believed he could left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.  Maybe in the sequel, the author addresses these difficult issues.","03 7, 2011",A29PZR73GSKBZT,"Shira Anthony ""Author & Avid Reader of M/M Ro...",1299456000

I was intrigued by Tad's character in the first book in the series.  He was our heroine's brother and he actually knew that he was a wolf, just hadn't been triggered and couldn't shift yet.  When he has to cancel on his sister for their annual trip because of work, he gets a surprise.  His high school crush is actually part of the company that hires him.  And Missy is actually a wolf and wanting to sort of mate with him.Her plans have to change when she realizes that they are really mates.  She's actually on the run in a way from the Alpha of her pack who wants to have her because she is an Omega wolf.Now not only does she have a real mate that she doesn't want to loose but he's not able to shift yet and will have to deal with big bad Alpha coming for them.This was short but very sweet, I loved Tad.  It was also nice that this story happens almost at the same time as book one so we see his side of the story when he finds out his sister is mated and now knows about being a wolf.

I enjoyed following both characters and learning about them, their pasts and their futures.Again I love this series and so far out of all the books this one was my favorite.

11217,B002FU6LYC,"[2, 2]",5,"For those of us who love to read and love our eReaders (I have two, one of them being a Kindle the other being another brand), the title of this book is totally captivating.  When I read the product description, I had to purchase it and the price was definitely right to take a chance on an author I was unfamiliar with.The premise of the story is that a new technological device has come along - the Gizmo - that does everything.  It's a phone, an MP3-type device and an eReader all combined into one handy gadget.  The comparisons to Amazon's own Kindle are obvious but with even more capability than just reading books.  Everyone in America has one of these handy dandy devices and just what does that mean for the bookstores selling traditional, paper books?  In our narrative, that means the demise of the bookshop and they are slowing closing with only a handful remaining.  Throughout the novel, they close one by one until only ""The Firebreathing Dragon"" remains.  How has it managed to not only stay open but make a tidy profit along the way, providing the financial support for the owner and two employees?  We find out when the owner dies and passes along not the bookstore and his home to his long-lost nephew.  The nephew and his wife come to Eureka, California to see what's what and discover a town filled with interesting characters and a culture vastly different than the one they left behind in the big city.  Should they give up the fast-paced lifestyle which has left them in debt up to their ears to continue running the quirky bookstore or should they sell and take the money?  Just how much is the bookstore making and how are they making anything in this out-of-the-way hamlet?  All these questions and more get answered.  In addition, the exploration of how this situation has evolved and the implication to the reading public will get the reader thinking about this very possibility.For originality and writing style, I definitely give this novel kudos.  A novel that I finished many days ago but still haunts me with the idea of an alternative world I am not too crazy about.  The setting of Eureka is described very well and the town itself becomes an intricate part of the work.  The number of characters is just about perfect - enough to give the story life but not enough to overwhelm the reader.  The characters themselves are quirky and interesting and I wanted to know more about them.  This is where the novel lost one star for me:  the characters weren't developed as much as I would have hoped.  I really liked them and found them fascinating, just not enough about them so felt I was left hanging just a bit.  Other than that, a wonderful novel that I enjoyed from beginning to end.","04 25, 2011",A11XAIFA10G7TS,"Holly ""Book addict""",1303689600

For some reason the only person who can help is ""human"" Callie. She has to go undercover, with two beaus, to smoke out the murderer. Only Tucker and Tyghe are not exactly uninterested in Callie, Callie isn't exactly un-magical and the Bad Guy is not someone anyone would have expected.Comments:- A short book (1488 kindle locations) but a complete story. Although it is the first in a series, the plot was completed, no hanging plot-threads as such.- The end of this book comes upon us very quickly. All this build up to find the murderer and *bam* it's over. Very disappointing. Yes, I like how it all came out, I like the HEA, I like who Callie becomes, but for all the long-winded clothes shopping and angst over placing Callie in such danger, the lack of action/danger/suspense is seriously disappointing- Sex is m/f (with possibility of being caught) and m/f/m. There are handcuffs and ""rough"" play (but no violence). The goal is a committed m/f/m relationship, and the males are brothers so no m/m. The sex is HOT and (mostly) loving. The three are forced together by fate/destiny so with that we get the ""is this really who we want/what we want"" angst. It makes the sex at times ""unwanted"", ""I'm only here, I only lust for you, because we have no choice"". A bit primal and feral. In the end, they come together with love as well as desire (how else do they get their HEA?) but it takes a few practice runs.- Callie should be an amazingly strong, interesting character. Instead she seems to have her fabulous traits ignored. Annoying.Opinion:So much possibility. What a shame it couldn't be seen through to the end. Loved the beginning. Loved the idea of loving Tucker and distant Tyghe being part of the Triune. Hated the reason Callie was left in an (apparently) abusive home, that Tyghe who treated her as a nothing her whole life was ""forgiven"", that presumably Moira knew all of this and did nothing, that this ""human"" was the only one to go undercover (if it had been Tucker's idea, as a cop, okay, but it wasn't), that Mitchell was pretty much ignored. Maybe there is more in the later books, but it does not appear so. If this is the sum and total of Callie's story I am very disappointed. After finishing this book I don't remember the wicked sex, the loving bonds, the exciting finale; I remember a character I wanted to know more about, who's story was half told.

This not only applies to plot lines and characters, but also to pacing and style. She created a new, wholly different reading experience with this book compared to the last one I read.What drew me in immediately were the two main characters, Lee and Cyn (or Sin, as she is also called). They are brutal yet endearing killers out to get revenge for the wrongful death of family members. They are cold at first, hard for the reader to understand, but this soon changes. When they finally begin to work together, as a team, the way the author builds their relationship is worth the entire book. I was so amused by their interactions, taking this book from a plot-driven thriller to a deeper level.  The plot itself is fun, fast-paced (although it could have done with a bit of trimming of some fight scenes), and the reader feels in good hands as the author weaves her story together. There are many moments of tension, including sexual tension, which send the reader's heart beating just a bit faster. There is also a wealth of combat and self-defense research in these pages, obviously demonstrating the care the author took to be as accurate as possible with the violence.This is a fun story that I can recommend without issue.

Caleb McCurdy has just been released from a five year stint in a Yuma prison. He'd taken the fall for his outlaw brothers who'd tried to rob the bank and left him holding the horses. He'd paid for his participation, but his soul is tormented by the deeds of his brothers at the Shafton Ranch. Caleb owed a debt to the widow Shafton for the killing of her husband, something he had tried to stop. Laura Shafton remembers that evil day five years before in her nightmares. She'd lost her husband but she had her son, Robbie; the unborn child she'd been carrying. She's wary of strangers, so when Caleb knocks on her door to offer work for food, she greets him with a shotgun. While Caleb is mending her gate, Robbie seems to disappear, only to be found hiding in a tree. On his way down the boy falls breaking his arm, and Caleb helps Laura set the break and splint it. This builds a certain amount of wary trust in Laura and she allows Caleb to stay in her tool shed and continue to work for food. Caleb fears that at any time Laura's going to recognize him as the 17 year old who had accompanied those evil men, but he's matured a lot since then and his body has grown strong. Laura too is no longer the teenage bride; she's now a strong independent woman. Their attraction is something that Caleb fights; for he knows that should Laura ever find out who his is she'll never forgive him.I really liked the plot for this story. The characters are very well developed and easy to like. Though both Laura and Caleb are in their early 20's in this book, they've both lived a life time in experiences. Caleb has always been a good man, but he'd been misguided by his need for family, and so he'd stuck with his brothers. Laura is incredibly strong and resilient, almost over the top so. She'll survive anything in order to protect and care for her son. Though I found myself skipping over paragraphs because the pace seemed slow, this was a good book, one of forgiveness and healing","02 22, 2012",A1PILXSH4D277C,"KayLovesToRead ""Tell us about yourself!""",1329868800

11896,B001TJ1O4W,"[0, 0]",5,"Angels' Pawn is the fantastic introduction to Singh's Guild Hunters series. Quite different in tone than Angels' Blood or Angels' Kiss, the novels that follow it, I actually enjoyed it more.The main characters in Angels' Pawn are the Guild Hunter Ashwini, and the vampire Janvier. (The main characters in the novels of the series are the hunter Elena, and archangel Raphael.) As some reviewers have mentioned, I felt a bit as if I was missing some world building backstory while reading the novella. However I had no problem figuring out what was going on, and it was one of my few complaints about the story.Singh's character development shines here, something particularly impressive given the short length of the book. Ashwini and Janvier are both interesting, well developed characters; they are each far from perfect, but their own resilience and self-acceptance gives them strength and makes them quite likeable. A cast of interesting side characters are also found throughout the story.Although the storyline touches on many of the same dark and violent themes that Angels' Blood and Kiss do, the overall tone is significantly lighter. This is due in large part, I think, to the main characters themselves. Their banter and sense of fun, as well as the kindness seen between them, gives a sense of perspective that the more solemn characters of Angels' Blood lack. Singh makes no attempt to wrap up Ashwini and Janvier's relationship in this story, although the particular ""mission"" is concluded. I think this was an intelligent choice, and far more satisfying than if she had tried to rush them into a happily ever after. Now I can't wait to see what adventure will bring them together next.","07 14, 2010",A23WE2XLY1MROA,Houston,1279065600

Towards the end, the writer tries to turn a bit serious and explores the whole ""love vs. marriage"", ""best for self vs. best for society/family/image"", and some kind of a tale of a revolutionary fighting against a cold, repressive government. A more skilled writer could have pulled it off but Ms. Gean is not that talented. The back half is where all the swearing begins out of nowhere. Curse words do not bother me but it's like, what happened? In New York she's like this sweet Southern Bell (even though she's not trying to be, I mean, come on now, she likes Nirvana and has a nose piercing!) but as soon as she gets back down to Memphis it's F this and F that. It's like Ms. Gean asked herself, ""How can I make this seem more serious and deep? I know, curse words!""The biggest annoyance are the characters. The artsy counter culture characters are a Hot Topic cliche (tattoos! piercings! dark make up! pink hair! Vans! and umm...

The prologue doesn't necessarily have to be really long or the length of the average book, it should just be long enough to set up everything for the series including the tone of it all.The reader is introduced to the Guardian of Hell-Geyron a beastly grotesque creature, and the Goddess of Oppression- Kadence who is beautiful beyond words.  Both have been stationed by their respective sides to guard and protect the wall into hell.  Kadence is bound to the wall so much so that if it crumbles she will die.  Geyron sold his soul to Lucifer and for that he is positioned to make sure that everything in hell stays there.  Kadence and Geyron have held these positions for centuries and they have never spoken until now.  Even though there were no words passed between them there was a mutual respect and attraction.The wall is beginning to show signs of damage and Kadence has to figure out a way to repair it.  Geyron could not help, even though he desperately wanted to.  In order to save the wall Kadence ended up making a deal with Lucifer, one she would later realize was a mistake.  While trying to repair the wall and take down the Demon Lords, Geyron and Kadence vocalize their feelings, desires, and wants for one another.  This is where it starts to get messy.  The Demon Lords have begun to truly destroy the wall.

She hadn't missed the almost physical relationship they had, but the friend that she trusted and confided in.Billy had reached a crossroads in his life.  He was at the top of his game in his professional life, but nothing else in his life satisfied him.  When he was asked to consult on a project in his hometown, he jumped at it.  Eden had never been far from his thoughts, and now he was going home to claim the woman made for him.  He didn't expect this to be an easy journey for him because his treatment of her so many years ago had been nothing short of abysmal.  His behavior was only one barrier keeping them apart, and the other was that his decision on the community center would have such a huge impact on Eden's life.  Billy could very well be stripping her job out from under her if his recommendation is to condemn the current building housing the center.  With all the issues circling them, Eden tried to resist the pull she felt toward Billy, but it was inevitable that they succumb to the intense heat between them.Eden is a strong character that has not had an easy life, but the loss of Billy was one loss she never recovered from.  Billy realized his error in judgment early on, and was back to claim the woman that had held his heart since high school.  While Eden scrambled to keep her armor in place, Billy did everything he could think of to penetrate it.

What they don't realize is that the woman they are looking for isn't a human; she is a Circ as well and she is about to experience her first change.Book 3 of Marie Harte's Circe's Recruits, Derrick is a bit of a disappointment.  First, I found it hard to believe that Sabrina and Derrick cared for each other.  I couldn't sense any feelings other than hormones between them.  Derrick's feelings for Sabrina stabilized the farther in the book I read and that helped some.  Sabrina's feelings were off; she kept constantly trying to leave knowing full well she would be brought back again.  My second disappointment with Derrick had to do with the storyline revolving around Sabrina accepting Roane as her alpha.  I read the first installment. I KNEW Roane was mated so what Sabrina had to do to show submission to him angered me greatly. I almost didn't finish reading Derrick because of it.

So, naturally I was very much looking forward to reading the book's sequel, The Hidden Will of the Dragon. Unfortunately, I was barely two chapters in when I realized this novel would be nothing like the first and was greatly disappointed as I continued to read.The main characters from Dandelions in the Garden, had stopped evolving with the ending of that book and instead digressed into hollow players in this drawn out and lackluster novel. The way the story was told had changed and by doing so, lost all appeal for me. There were also far too many errors throughout this book for me to over look. I had noticed some in the previous story but didn't pay much attention to them since the story itself provided a satisfying read, but Hidden Will of the Dragon was completely riddled with them! I understand this falls partly on the editor, or lack of one if that's the case, but either way it should have been picked through and polished before publishing.Hidden Will picks up where Dandelions left off but doesn't flow along with the original story quite right. I had grown fond of Amara, Elizabeth's lady in waiting, admiring her strong will and ability to keep her head when everything around her was falling to pieces. I had enjoyed reading about her romances and her troubles, about her marriage and the strong bond she and her husband had between them. In this book, there isn't a bit of that. Amara is weak, needy and someone I ended up not being able to stand. And then there's Elizabeth, who I no longer sympathized with and just like with Amara, couldn't tolerate. She was out of her mind, annoyingly self centered and her actions were pointless.I feel absolutely awful having to leave this review! I enjoyed the first book and had assumed the second would be an accurate follow up but it fell flat, very flat. The story was there, and could have been saved and written in a way where the reader still felt attached to the characters they had connected with before, instead of having to read far too many pages without being able to absorb it. I'm sure there are many readers out there who enjoyed this book, and I'm glad that they did! This is just my opinion and I know that doesn't mean others will share it, but I have to say that I do not recommend this read.","07 10, 2012",AQM2NGU71RI2C,"A.G. Dow ""A.G. Dow""",1341878400

The fact that it's relatively short and just 99 cents definitely helped. But frankly, I was a little disappointed.First, the other reviewer's comment about the formatting for Kindle was spot on. Bizarre characters, strange indenting, chapter titles that start at the bottom of a page, typos - it needs some cleaning up. It's very distracting when you're trying to get into a story. That said, the formatting in no way influenced my rating.The Haircut is a wonderful concept but the execution could have been better. The back and forth in the barber shop went on *forever* using the same words and phrases. I understand that the barber was conflicted about the girl's request. I understand the girl wanted it done ""like the boy's haircut."" But the characters just kept saying the exact same thing. I enjoy scenes of conflict but this one just got tedious.As I said, I don't read romances so perhaps this is a common device, but the repetition throughout seemed to be included to simply fill space. It was so distracting and frustrating, in fact, that I simply stopped reading about 60% in. I mean, the ending isn't any secret, is it?So why did I give it three stars? It's a lovely story, and I really enjoyed learning a little about Misha.

With that being said here's what I can tell you about what I have read--there's no character development, Ral all but rapes Ariel in the first chapter, he's not really a sexy leading man with his razor sharp teeth which kinda makes the ""love"" scene a little scary, he talks like a caveman but is some super strong intelligent alien race. Ariel, while I could see would be some frightened girl is pretty much a shell she has no personality and falls in love with this Alien who rapes her and finds she just loves having sex with him, here I can only say . . . wait . . . what? There's too many poorly written sex scene don't get me wrong I love a good romance and I appreciate well written love scenes but these were lack luster and seemed to come on every other page. Also once they make it to his home planet the author was not very creative, the world consist of three colors, I love red, purple and black but the whole planet in this three color palette is boring.

When Kaylee suddenly feels one of her panic attacks starting to come on, she hopes to avoid a public meltdown. When she fails to avoid the source of her panic attack, she begins to scream uncontrollably in the middle of the mall. When she cannot stop screaming, she is sedated and wakes up in the psychiatric unit at the local hospital.I have read the first three books in the Soul Screamers series, and then I heard about the Soul Screamer Challenge put on by Fiktshun. I decided it would be fun to start over and read all the novellas along the way. I am really glad I did after read My Soul to Lose for the first time. If you have read even the first book in the Soul Screamers series, there are little things to notice in the novella. It is kind of fun, because it almost like a private joke for someone who has already been introduced to Soul Screamers. I hope that re-reading the books and reading the novellas will open my eyes to things I did not notice before.My Soul to Lose is a super fast, but awesome read. It is a great start to an amazing series. I am curious about Lydia, and I do not know if she ever returns in future books. I cannot wait to read all the books and find out.

7758,B004IEAEL4,"[13, 16]",5,"I had so many issues with this kindle book that I almost don't know where to start.The very first thing I noticed was the formatting.  One of things I love about my kindle is the ability to choose the font type.  This book as formatted some odd way that you can only view it in blocky font that can't be changed.  You can change the size but you are stuck with this obnoxious font.  I almost quit reading at that point but decided it was my own stupid fault for not reading a sample so I kept going.I am quite frankly amazed I finished it.  This book could have done with some major overhauling by a halfway decent editor. I found multiple incidents of spelling errors (liberarian instead of librarian is a good example).  The descriptive detail in the book was repetitive and distracting.  Here is a good example ""We have waited and watched, we thought they had left and then this.  Who ever it is, they had waited and watched"" or ""Quin returned to his office and went to his office""There is also the poor sentence construction through out the story.  It is a toss up if I noticed more run on sentences or fragments in this book.  Poor syntax and improper use of punctuation also constantly distracted me and ruined the reading experience.  At one point I was reminded of a high school English test I had where the teacher had deliberately made multiple errors in a story and the students were expected to find and correct all errors.As to the story line, it had potential but I just couldn't enjoy it.  The few times I was able to ignore everything I just mentioned, I found the writing stilted and boring.  Real people just don't talk like the ones in this book.  The writing  was very juvenile sounding and this could only be compared to a high school students class project.  If my teenager turned in this book for a writing class, I would expect it to come back with a C - at the very best along with a note suggesting the student resubmit it after spending more time on it.Because of all the problems I have just mentioned, this was only the second time in two years I have found myself requesting a refund for a book from amazon.  Considering the other time I asked for a refund was because I quit reading the second a pair of twin brothers started having sex with each other, that says a lot!  Even though I only paid $2 for this book, I felt ripped off and left with no choice but to ask for a refund.  Do yourself a favor and do not read this book unless you need a good example of how not to write a book.","10 31, 2011",AFIXEMW563WWG,S. weiler,1320019200

Deep undercover to try to nail a particularly offensive weapons trafficker who doesn't trust nor do business with sexually straight people, they're forced into an intimacy that Alex hadn't anticipated - but what really makes him worry is just how much he enjoys the six month deep cover operation. What shocks him is when his Aussie partner and friend, Matthews, comes clean on both his bi-sexuality AND his interest in Alex. An interest that supersedes any work-related cover op.And from that point on, Alex's life - as neurotic and repressed as it was - turns on its ear and becomes uncomfortable, uncertain, and wracked with yearning.

Phil wants to pursue a relationship with Thom, but Thom's reluctant to have any sort of relationship with a boss.  Other issues intrude as well.  Can these two very different men figure out a way to be together?The Happy Onion has a little something for everyone.  There's humor, emotion, hot sex, and even some suspense.  The characters are all very likeable, especially the hot-tempered, young-looking Thom and Phil, whose delight in annoying Thom just to get a reaction made me snicker.  The conflicts between Thom and Phil struck me as realistic, especially given how different the two men were and how Phil felt about Thom's future employers.  Of course, the love scenes between them are hot and sometimes emotional as well.  While The Happy Onion won't be replacing Eight Arms to Hold You or Willow Bend as my favorite Ally Blue book, it was certainly an enjoyable read.

That lasted about a chapter, maybe 2.  I have really enjoyed the this author's previous work and was looking forward to a what I thought would be a story about a reluctant h and a remorseful H that had to woo the h back in love with him.  Since this never happened, I am not sure why the book had this title.  Other than the H carrying a box for the h and giving her a kitten, there really was no wooing at all.  They have sex and then he reacts like a total jerk after they are done but instead of apologizing he gives her a lame line of ""what I did was unforgivable so I am not going to ask you to forgive me.""  This was after he has locked her in a jail cell for her to listen to him (his the sheriff).  I guess even after what she did I thought that how he acted he needed to get on his knees to beg for forgiveness and really showing remorse instead of acting high handed but he continually doubts and compares the h to the actions of his ex-wife.  When the h intervenes between his daughter and him, the H immediate response is ""you told her,"" referring to a secret that the H had shared with the h regarding the daughter.  She let's that go and then later in the book he also questions her honesty regarding a major event which to me was just the last straw.  He is just one of those characters that because he had been burned once before and therefore will forever continue to think the worse of all women, the h included.  He never once believed the best of the h nor did he really have to ever work for the h love.  Instead the H continually took her for granted.  The h is just disappointing because throughout the book she stand up to the H just long enough to give lip service just before she lays down to be his doormat.  The end was just so unbelievably annoying that I didn't even read the last two pages.  Yes, I had two pages to go and I just could not do it.  H shows up after continually treating the h like crap and hurting her and in one paragraph all is fine and well, until the next time that life doesn't go his way and then somehow that will be the h fault again and I'm sure she will agree with that as well.  The only time he steps up is when someone else wanted her or if it was easy and convenient to him, this to me this a romance does not make.

2656,B002ASASUM,"[2, 2]",5,"Moonlight Hero takes an unusual path to romance, mixing it up with a bad guy who seems unstoppable against a happy-go-lucky alpha who shows his strengths in a less than usual way.Kiera is the heroine and right away the reader is aware she's a good girl who only wants to stay out of trouble. Little does she know that trouble, in the form of a vampire, is only the beginning of her journey to discovery. What she learns about herself, her strengths and the lengths she'll go to grab onto and keep her happiness is what made me enjoy this story so much. Another point in this book's favor is the author didn't constantly dwell on the typical internal angst that easily could have taken over this story as its conflict. Rather, she concentrated on the joy of it and I found that even the pursuit of happiness requires a diligent commitment to the earning and giving trust. Without it, there can't be emotional growth.Gabriel is the hero and alpha of his pack. He's not the typical political and heavy-handed ""I'm the alpha, that's why"" kind of character. He's a bit more laid back, mostly because of where he lives, his environment and his ignorance that werewolves aren't the only thing that goes bump in the night. In fact, he finds out the hard way that movies are so, so wrong on a lot of things. Gabriel is an alpha for a reason, however, and that becomes excitingly apparent when the tension and suspense picks up. Another thing I like is that he's not a know-it-all. Gabriel makes some misjudgments which, though at first glance I felt were a character flaw, I then realized that he is fallible, like everyone else. Just because he is a paranormal creature doesn't mean he's not going to act like a typical guy - clueless. I had real sympathy for this character from that point on because he really does love Kiera and he's so `guy' about expressing it.The villain is, of course, the vampire. He's a jerk. A warped, twisted, arrogant being of whom I thought the author depicted quite well. I had no sympathy for him at all so he's the perfect bad guy.Other secondary characters populated this story, some sounded a bit too good to be true, some were endearing and two made my interest spike. It was a good balance all around. The dialogue was fast paced and moved the plot along.Moonlight Hero is not only romantic, but it's exciting and captures the joys of being a couple who know how to heat the sheets (and do something else that I'll not tell you about). They show by example how to live in the moment and grab onto the future with both hands while making no apologies for doing so. Gabriel and Kiera's story is one you are going to enjoy.[...]","08 11, 2009",A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,"LAS Reviewer ""The Long and the Short Of It Re...",1249948800

10423,B001V9KG4E,"[40, 50]",5,"This book really confused me. I was able to put most of my questions aside and enjoy the book for what it was- a Swiss Family Robinson story about teenagers.OK, now for my many quibbles:1) This book would be YA but there's lots of sexual innuendo and implied sex scenes.  Ok, so I guess I'm an old fogey and am forgetting that the young'uns are maturing way faster than before.  But this is what I really don't like about the book- the fact the ""adults"" in the story (defined pretty much as everybody over the age of 20) start pairing off with...the teenagers. Yup. The chief of teens instigates a rule that you cant have sex before age 16, and maybe a couple that is 16 and 20 or 21 is ok.  But what we have are, err, a mature mother of two (I think she's close to 30) and a 16 year old (she does joke about robbing the cradle but then follows up confessing she has erotic dreams about him).  Then there's a construction worker/handyman who has to be in his mid-20's at least, who gets in bed (but no sex! yeah right!) with a...14 year old girl.  I'm sure you will love the scenes where he fantasizes about her perky, err, bottom clothed in skinny jeans, and the day she wears a teeny tiny skirt.  Very uncomfortable reading this, to say the least.2) So, teens will be teens. Referring to my comment #1, the sex between the teens, though slightly unsavory, is realistic in the end.  Now, oddly enough, the premise for bringing them all together is the fact they were all attending an abstinence camp.  Whizz goes the irony! sorry, though, there were no religious connotations at all in the book. Nor did these seem like your bunch of bad behaving kids sent to labour camp. Is there really, really such a thing as an abstinence camp that is not related to the church? Did the author just choose this setting for the irony?3) Again, teens will be teens. I'm alright with some of them being more mature and taking charge, even if the Chief is a 15 year old. But what about the emotions? It really seemed the kids took one paragraph to get over the shock of being stuck atop the mountain...then boom, they are back to playing and chatting. No thoughts of mom or dad? Siblings? Friends back home? It's like these kids shrug at the fact life as they know it has changed drastically. Kids are resilient but to have none of them freak out and break down emotionally at the thought of being alone with no family is just really bizarre.4) The gender issue. Hey, I'm a girl and I once was a teenager. I will admit at one point, all I cared about was getting a phone in my room. I was extremely shallow with my clothing, makeup, friends. So no surprise at some of the girls' behavior in this book.  However, for ALL of them to be such sheep? The two girls who join the ""inner circle"" (the group in charge) admit that most of their acceptance by the guys  is because they're the ""girlfriends."" and then the Chief blurts that fact out loud. Reaction?  Nada. I think a few girls toss their hair and/or stomp off to pout. But that's really about it. Geez would it kill to have the girls actually gang up and retaliate a bit?5) The ""science""...or lack thereof. There's a weird fog surrounding the mountain. there's creepy stuff in it that kills. According to the prologue the fog is alien in nature or something like that. Ooooh. But then that's the only mention of the fog in that context. Dang it, would it kill to have one or more of the teens try to investigate the fog? Or the ""army specialists"" do some research into the fog?  Everyone just seems to lie back and accept it all. Not one thought on how to escape. Ugh!Well there's more but I feel I've ranted enough. If this weren't a free ebook, i would be a lot more pissed but at least I didn't waste money on this.","05 16, 2011",A10CIHFHGR4IPJ,puggle,1305504000

9022,B000R93D4Y,"[18, 18]",5,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBianca D'Arc takes readers into an alternate world where dragons exist. In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora. Despite my initial hesitation about this series, I think I enjoy the world enough to read more about it!*ARC provided by publisher","08 29, 2012",A1JKGTL51HHTU1,Under The Covers Book Blog,1346198400

He sees forever and is anxious to grab onto that dream with every ounce of feeling he has.Johnny and Millie each know that their time together is short.  Millie's father is adamant that she become what he wants her to be and teaching is not part of the plan - neither is a man like Johnny.

Lissa Matthew's came out with a book called Masked and mentioned on her blog that one of the main characters, Thor, was in this book. So after I finished Masked, I pulled this book out of the archives to read it once again.Aidn is a much sought after Dominant in a local club called Abyss. After a traumatic split with a submissive years ago, he only takes on trainees and one-night submissives. But he has come to realize he is bored with the same things and vanilla just isn't for him any more. Unfortunately, he has a hard time reconciling this with himself.Bailey is coming into her own. After not being able to work out her marriage, she has divorced and started her own bakery business. She knows Aidn from causal meetings at the Abyss, but never thought of him seriously knowing his reputation. When he approaches her outside of the lotion shop she can't believe he wants to have sex with her. She is comfortable with herself, but she knows not everyone is into larger women.They have a steamy afternoon in her place above the bakery. From the counter-top to the bed, they both believe this is just a one time affair, but Aidn gets the feeling she is the submissive for him and runs in fear. This is the theme for the story. She is ready to accept her submissive side and knows Aidn is the one, but Aidn can't let go of the past and continues to leave her several times during the course of this novella.While I understood why he had a hard time with what happened with his ex, it is no different from someone who gets a divorce. Eventually you have to get back up and if it falls in  your lap, you deal with it. He always seemed to be running and using Bailey and he knew it. I liked his character though.

Similar with many writers the object is to keep wandering around many irrelevant ideas to add &#34;texture&#34;.  I suspect most readers read a line or two each page in order to make some headway into the story.  One also has to accept absurd achievements similar to a James Bond movie.  It's better to read this than some sex novel written by someone with a demented mind.  Lynn in Jacksonville OR,"01 29, 2013",A3T7BLQYX2OYB0,Lynn,1359417600

I'm sad to say that it fell short of my expectations. It wasn't the most original book I've ever read, it didn't have a very exciting plot, the characters were shallow and static, and the overall theme was un-impressive. I expected this story to be as witty and interesting as Flat-Out Love, but it wasn't even in the same ball-park, which was extremely disappointing. I think three stars is fair for this book; it is well-written and an enjoyable story, but there's nothing spectacular about it and the plot was virtually non-existant.

Kylie spends her whole life learning her Dads business, resents Bas coming in to help run it, then turns around and sells it two months after her dad dies when she realizes she loves Bas and wants to follow him back to Charlotte. Then Vanessa's reason for not trusting Cameron in the last book was weak at best. His job? Also didn't like the ending of Vanessa Steele's story. It went against the character buildup of Cameron being strong and the controller of his world for the story to end with him huddled in a basement waiting for a rescue.  He's a Texan!  I Would have preferred a rescue scene or one where Cameron hid her away then grabbed his shotgun (you don't live on a 10 acre ranch without one) made a cell call to his friends and then went out and took care of business in a Westmorelands/Madarises kind of way.

1850,B0015YEQNM,"[1, 1]",5,"This is the complete trilogy, plus a short story, of Poison Study (Book 1), Magic Study (Book 2), and Fire Study (Book 3).Poison Study was Ms. Snyder's debut novel, and it was excellent! I borrowed the hard copy, and enjoyed it so much, I immediately bought the Bundle so I would have all the books, and all in the same place. I will be buying more of Ms. Snyder's books!These books are what I would call High Fantasy, though there are no dragons. There are Sorcerers, Magicians, and of course, Mundanes - no dragons. I believe they would easily cross to a genre I seldom read and even more seldom enjoy, Romance.As I read fiction for escape, this was perfect! I could escape into a world lush with characters, geography, and conflict.Poison Study starts off with our heroine, Yelena, being brought out of her cell in the dungeon to stand before the #2 man of the country. He gives her a choice. She can face the executioner for her crime of killing the son of a noble, or she can face the possibility of a slow and agonizing death at some future date, and become the official taster of the Commander (who runs the country.)Because there might be a way for her to escape, and this is at the beginning of the story, she accepts the latter. An honest person, she wins either the fast and loyal friendship of many, or the undying hatred.When the Commander took over the country, he outlawed all magic, seeing it as evil, and any who had abilities either did their best to escape to Ixia, where magic was not only allowed, but nurtured, or were killed trying.As the story unfolds, we learn Yelena was an orphan, taken and raised under the protection and education of General Brazell (whose son she killed). By the end of the story, we learn she was not an orphan, but had been kidnapped for her hoped for, and anticipated, magical abilities.Life for Yelena was not pleasant in the orphanage, and only slightly more pleasant as a Taster, but at least it was life.Magic Study finds Yelena reunited with her birth family, and on her way to learning to use and control her magic. Again, her choice is: Learn to use it, or burn yourself out, unless killed first.In Magic Study, she finds herself in a strange place, untrusted, even by her brother, accused of being a spy, with few friends, and a nasty habit of charging ahead without thinking everything through.Fire Study is the third and final book in the trilogy. Yelena finds her true magic, which frightens everyone, including her. She is a Soulfinder, one of the most powerful of all magics. By now all the characters are known, or at least most of them, and we're aware of Yelena's foibles, and her undying loyalties.She tries to avert a war, is caught, imprisoned, escapes, and has a price on her head. The First Magician wants her dead, the Fire Starter wants her soul, and the Commander's Assassin wants her.For the most part, this was a page burner. Once I started reading it, it was very difficult to put down. So why only 4 stars? Because Ms. Snyder knows better than to use lazy language such as, ""Me and him..."" and the 3d and final book had entirely too many of those. Each time I read that phrase, it threw me out of the story, and I had to work my way back in. It jarred. The more of them I read, the stronger the jar.Although ""Me and...."" drives me crazy, it may not bother you. Perhaps that is the way you speak and write, and you have no idea it is the epitome of laziness in the use of American English; if so, it won't bother you, and you will probably not even notice.The stories were great fun. I look forward to my next Maria V. Snyder novel. She has a wonderful imagination, and a great ability to create new and interesting worlds.","10 20, 2013",A1O2I3BAX8FXZN,Rainy Day,1382227200

Daphne is expected to do this in 24 hours just like the Charles Dickens tale, however none of the three ghosts had sex with Scrooge within the first 24 hours so I guess the timeframe and the bah-humbug attitude are the only similarities.  Not once in the entire story did I feel that there was any real chemistry.  I pictured Daphne snapping gum and saying groovy the whole time while crusty Nat just leeringly undressed her with his eyes...this somehow was to build up to a kind of love ever-after that would allow second chances for Daphne and Nat. Really?  The unnecessary sex scene was also stale and blah and did not fit into the story at all, very...random...Is she an Angel or a succubus?  Not buying it.

7934,B003K16TME,"[0, 1]",5,"2.5 stars.I have a somewhat two-minded opinion about Force of Law.On one hand, it was a nice, light and entertaining enough read. A fun parody--even though trying too hard at times. Nothing heavy. Nothing that requires much attention/concentration. Nothing breath-taking and outstanding that will be remembered forever, but entertaining, nonetheless.On the other hand, it just was too much, at times--even though the book is intentionally cliched and over the top:Law is this alpha male of all alpha males. He's super talented, smart, intelligent, successful, powerful, dominant, rich, handsome, fearleass, brave, honourable, strong-minded. He's a billionaire. He's got the world laid out to his feet. Everyting he does or touches turns into gold. He might be a god..., he certainly feels and behaves like one. He's awfully arrogant or sure of himself--however you'd like to interpret it. When planning a picnic, he's using his helicopter or jet to get there, flying the thing himself, naturally. When confronted with a gun (while being unarmed himself) he fearlessly and single-handedly, and, of course, successfully--was there ever any doubt?--wrestles the gun-holding ""opponent"" for the gun, knocking him out easily while he's at it. And that's that. He joined the force and went to Afghanistan for no other reason than to kill Osama Bin Laden himself. While fighting bravely at the front for freedom and against terrorism, he's running his corporation via satellite (his private one, of course) and quite successfully so.In contrast to Law Tom--although being refered to as tough (why?)--can only be compared to a damsel in distress, helplessly waiting for the shining knight in armor to save the day or, which would be more appriopriate in Law's case, to save the world. I don't really like this kind of dynamic in a relationship, neither straight nor gay.And the rape-but-not-rape scene wasn't anything I liked very much, either. Tom was scared to death, waiting for the inevitable while trying to convince himself that it won't be all that bad, that it will be OK, and he just realizes that he's actually turned on as hell the second he feels Law's *** (or, to put it nice: member) up his virgin ***. That was too close for comfort. (A D/s [BDSM] dynamic is fine, even hot, but here it isn't. The thing between Law and Tom is not a D/s thing, not in that way.) I couldn't find anything remotely romantic in that.Yes, this book wants to be a parody, wants to be over the top.

I subscribed the first day I found out about it and have not been disappointed. I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess). Some pictures are now beginning to appear too. The ads are gone (so unless you only buy the paper for the ads - some people do - you will be pleased). The Contents, Sections and Next Article layout is great. From the main page you can just skim all the headlines by hitting the next page button until you get to the end - and then you'll know you haven't missed any of today's headlines. If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there).

This was a cute little shifter tale, and a good start to the series in-so-far-as it was able to establish both setting and future goals for our shifter society.  That said, I still would have liked to have seen more world building, and was quite annoyed with the author when there was a chance expand the readers understanding of the shifter society and where it would be heading in the future and the opportunity was passed over in favor of our hero not paying attention to what was being said.  I found this shortcut a tad bit sloppy/lazy.  Ms. Andrews did excel at incorporating the hot and steamy parts and building that into a romantic relationship and not just a casual fling; commendable in such a short word-count without pre-existing relationships.  The characters were likeable, and even the secondary characters were somewhat defined.

I was most impressed by the landscape of the story which I think, must be real place unless it sprung from the figment of the writers imagination. I wouldn't be surprised if it did, considering that the rest of the story is littered with similarly breathtaking descriptions. You can always tell when the writer can actually see the surroundings and the characters. It's even more satisfying when the writer can see it and then paint it so vividly for the rest of us.The connection between the two characters is real and very sweet. The sex scenes are descriptive without ever edging into the vulgarity that is so common in this genre (and if I may say unnecessary). I've read the other reviews and someone complained that there wasn't enough action in the book. I guess if you are looking for an action story, you might be disappointed. I don't think this was the writers purpose in the first place and I don't believe it was advertised as an action book.Now for the bad stuff. Even for fiction, everything about this story is just too convenient. I understand having to neatly tie up the loose ands, but this was knitted so tight it could stop a bullet. Maybe a happy ending is a requirement for a lot of writers, and I'll never be the one to complain about a happily ever after. But, we all know life is messy. Sometimes, even in the worst mess, there is beauty that can't be matched by perfection.

3256,B002TSAORU,"[4, 5]",5,"Plot/Storyline: 3 StarsThis book reminded me tremendously of Stephen King's Rose Madder.  It had many similar elements, like a woman with an abusive ex, a supernatural being, and some other portions of the ending that I can't disclose.  A big difference was that the main character, Izzy, had a thirteen year old son, Connor. Another major difference, of course, was the setting, so I guess this is the UK answer to King's novel.  Having really enjoyed King's book, I certainly was not adverse to reading a similar one.The book had a pretty good pace to it. While it had sections of sluggishness, for the most part it moved pretty quickly. I enjoyed the backstory of ""Coombe's Woods"" in the first retelling by an old guy at a pub. It was an interesting tale told in a way that evoked plenty of emotion. It had the feel of a scary ghost story told by a campfire.The inclusion of the ""elf"" element was a real turn off for me. I really felt as though the book would have been much more realistic without that little side plot. Elves?  Really?The intervening letters to her friend and parents were helpful at times, but odd at others. At one point, she thought she saw someone she used to know, but when that person walked away, she appeared to assume that it was just her imagination. However, she later sent a letter to her friend about the incident, using the assumption that it was who she thought it was and ranting about it.  Then, in the regular narrative, she doesn't think much about the incident at all for a long time.The romantic side plot was a lukewarm addition. There were no sparks; there was no romance. As a matter of fact, Izzy seemed to almost think, ""Well, I might as well be with him, since he's male, likes my kid, and is so accessible.""The suspense buildup was sorely lacking. Except in the action sequences, I never felt any fear. It was almost as if the horror portion was just another side plot.Characters: 4 StarsIzzy was a terrific main character. She was earthy and so authentic that most women, whether they had been in her situation or not, could easily identify with her.  Now, I must admit here that I did not like her at all. While she managed to pull her head out of her a** now and then for the sake of her son, she was not only a very weak women, but spent way too much time in the book crying, fainting and drinking. But, then again, she was still realistic.Connor was a refreshing change from the usual, saccharine-sweet children in novels.  The best word to describe him is ""brat."" In other words, he was just like most young teens, wrapped up in himself. I was surprised at the language he used, that Izzy allowed him to use. However, I have to just chalk that up to differences in parenting styles.  UnfortunatelyFeathers was the weak link in the story. He was undeveloped and rather boring as a romantic interest.Writing Style: 4 1/2 StarsThere were some misplaced clauses here and there that caused me to have to reread sentences to get the meaning. However, this was not prevalent. Mostly, the writing style was pretty clear. The descriptions were exceptionally vivid, with terrific imagery. The dialogue was realistic most of the time, with the small exception of some characters using too flowery language when recounting a story.Editing: 4 1/2 StarsI found just a few too many editing issues, such as incorrect homophones and punctuation problems.  The errors I found didn't mar the reading experience.","03 2, 2011",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,1299024000

It isn't until his friends and new home is threatened by Alan Matthews does he finally take a stand and kill his former pack leader.  Even now in is new home of Red Rock and under a much more kind alpha, Dylan is still pained by is inner scars from his previous life.  He does not just want to sit around and be taken care of by others but wants to help and be of use.Sasha Wallace watched as her mentor was savagely murdered and left with a few scars of her own but it's the ones that she can't see that hurt her more.  The citizens of Red Rock make her feel nervous and is under constant watch because of her magic.  One of the few that is able to calm and make her feel at ease is Dylan.  He saved her life and sees her as more than just a witch.  With every passing moment that they spend together, their attraction for one another grows.  But will Sasha stay in Red Rock long enough to explore her desire and feelings for Dylan or will she flee the moment she has repaid her debt?Dylan has been a character I've been interested in since the beginning of the series.  He is unselfish and will do whatever he can to help in the war with his former pack in Helena.  My only complaint is that I think he takes on too much of the blame.  He blames himself for what happen to Abby (story in Cry Sanctuary), her sister Brynn (story in Sanctuary Lost) and for the entire war.  It isn't until Sasha comes in that he finally takes a break from the self blame and his character becomes more than it has been.  He is not an alpha wolf but Sasha brings his wolf closer to the surface and I like that.  Sasha had been badly hurt and is terrified but with Dylan she is able to relax and feel safe and confident again.  There is some fight when it comes to admitting how she really feels (isn't there always?) but together, they begin to heal each others wounds.  I think what I like most about their relationship is that Dylan isn't dominate like an alpha would be toward his mate.  Not that there aren't protective instincts in him and he does want it known she is his, its just since he is more gentle with her the relationship is more charming and sweet than the ones in the previous books.Their relationship isn't the only event going on in the book.  It is brought to everyone's attention that there is an evil vampire working against them in the war.  Dylan and Sasha along with Joe and Brynn are sent to seek help from a vampire friend of Red Rock's alpha Gavin that lives in Maine.  When they get there they see that the pack has their own crises they are dealing with that includes an alpha trying to take over the pack and a female vampire that has an eye out for the blood and power inside of Brynn.  It was good to see Joe and Brynn again.  I enjoyed reading their story in Sanctuary Lost and I like to see my favorite characters make an appearance.  Brynn suffered a lot in the previous book and I liked that her and her struggle were included in this book.  I think I would have been a little disappointed if it wasn't.This book has a bit of everything.  Action, romance, steamy love scenes and sarcasm which is always one of my favorite things to read.  Sanctuary's Price is the third book in Moira Rogers' Red Rock series and is so far my favorite.  Each book is better than the one before and I have yet to be disappointed by anything from them.  I'm addicted to their characters, story and the world they built.  I can't wait for the the next installment in the Red Rock Series, Sanctuary Unbound.  Two words, lumberjack vampire.

The Hold as it is known is a prison located under the poisonous sea of Genus 6 where no one escapes from.  The Hold is a mixed gender open prison with very few lockable cells.  The prisoners are thrown together and fight amongst themselves for food.  The guards to nothing to help the prisoners it is a free for all where fighting, rape and stealing are a daily occurance.  Upon entering the prison Riana is advised by one of the guards to find the strongest man there and give herself to him as payment for his protection.So from the description of the book I was very keen and excited to read this.  It looked like an interesting plot, a women trying to survive in a dangerous futuristic prison and obviously there was going to be a guy and some romance going on, I thought it was going to be a good book from other reviews that I had read.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The start was good and the story was very bleak and dark, just my kind of thing, then Riana meets Cain the imprisoned guy she gives herself to for protection and the story turns into some kind or porn with the plot as a side story.  I was fed up reading about all the times they had sex and in what position and who was watching.  I was looking forward to one or two hot sex scenes after being teased into a frenzy by the author but this just wasn't the case.  I also didn't like the language Ms Adams used.  Don't get me wrong I am not against swearing in fact I have a bad potty mouth myself but I felt it was inappropriate.  I also didn't think this language fitted with the type of character that Riana was being portrayed as.  I so wanted Ms Adams to concentrate on the promising plot rather than how good Cain was at thrusting.  There was very little Sci-Fi in this book and I nearly gave up on it a couple of times.  I really don't like giving a negative review for a book, and please note that this is my honest opinion, as I mentioned earlier I have seen a lot of reviews for this book where people really liked it, however it just wasn't for me.

She never stays in one town more than one month, remaining as unattached as possible so that leaving is easier to bear.  But when she takes a job at Turner Industries, staying isolated proves impossible as she finds herself irresistibly drawn to her employer, Kyle Turner III.  Still, she avoids becoming involved with him past their working relationship - that is, until her clairvoyant abilities show her a fatal vision involving Kyle!Kyle knows all about Aislinn's past, in minute detail.  Being ex-Special Forces and in the security industry, it is his business to know everything about the people close to him - especially pretty little personal assistants who distract him like no other woman can.  He has no intention of letting Aislinn run again, not when he can protect her from her past and keep her close to him, where she belongs...I do not think Annmarie McKenna can do wrong with a story.  I have loved every piece of her work I have read so far!  Two Sighted was a pleasure both to read and to write a review for.  It is books like this that make my job simple, and I wish they could all be this good.Kyle Turner III pushed every button I have, proving that this author knows just what women love in their heroes.  In fact, if you could place orders for men that would exactly suit your needs, I would want McKenna's help placing the order since she seems to know what I want better than I do myself!  Kyle is the epitome of the overprotective Alpha male who pursues the woman he loves with an unwavering focus and a sensitivity that belies his `he-man' status.Aislinn's fear and loneliness are palpable as she longs for those simple human comforts long denied her - a best friend, a phone call with her mother, a man to fall in love with, a home that is hers for longer than 8 months.  Yet even in her determination to remain detached, we see that she can't help but care about those around her.  While her abusive ex-husband may have stolen her sense of belonging, her hopes for a future, he hasn't robbed her of her empathy.  While it might be easy to be jealous of the woman who captures the attentions of the hunky Kyle, no one could begrudge Aislinn for stealing his heart.I was impressed with Annmarie McKenna's very first novel,Blackmailed, and my admiration for her work grows with each new release.  In Two Sighted, she effortlessly sets the stage for a sequel starring several of the supporting leaving her fans aching for it without leaving this book feeling unfinished in any way.

If it had better characterization and editing I might have given it four stars. The writer may be a new author? My recommendation is to buy the trilogy which is available as single download.There are some very creative elements in these books as far as tactics and political structure goes, but there are some real leaps of faith around the structure of the formation of a global response here on Earth.This is old fashioned science fiction where one man and heroic effort by a team of no nonsense military men deliver nearly impossible results in next to no time. You will read some political posturing based on today's situation and you may be tempted to stereotype the authors political views but don't be too quick to judge.Now the story, it is a fast based space opera with elements of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the beautiful alien princess and archaic code of honor, E.E. Smith, the rapacious and clearly evil alien races (no, not as bad as the Chlorans or Boskone) but it is easy to identify the villains, both aliens and humans and often the human villains come across as worse than theThe hero is one Alexander Thorson, an ex-NFL player, ex-Air Force pilot and actually an ex-lots of things.

8961,B0042JSSE0,"[22, 23]",5,"MATE SET by Laurann Dohner.STORY BRIEF:Most humans are unaware that werewolves are living in their community.  Mika is a human who was adopted by Omar's sister.  She knows Omar is a werewolf and keeps the secret.  She lives in California but visits Omar for a few weeks a year.  Omar loves her and is protective of her.  This year she unknowingly visits during werewolf mating season.  Large numbers of werewolves visit the area and will rape her if they get the chance.  Omar asks Grady to live with Mika for two weeks to protect her from the males. Grady is sexually drawn to Mika but won't touch her because of her uncle's threats.  A rival clan member wants Mika and tells Grady he will take her unless she is marked by Grady.  To avoid a werewolf war and save Mika, Grady is forced to mark her.  Now that she is marked he must have frequent sex with her or go insane.  She likes it.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was pretty good at the start.  I liked the following conversation (at 380).  Omar's girlfriend Minnie is talking.  ""I was mated when I was younger and it sucked.  Being mated pretty much makes you a damn slave that a mated man thinks he owns lock, stock, and barrel.  He orders you around and treats you like property because you are his.  It's in their damn blood when they mate to take it to the extreme.""  I also liked a cute scene in which Omar is going to assign a guard to Mika based on which man looks at her body the least.  Mika didn't want a guard so she dressed as sexy as possible.  This caused some gaping expressions.But as the story progressed I became more and more disappointed.  The main conflicts between the two were based on inaccurate assumptions and vague communication.  Mika was falling in love with Grady, but he didn't reciprocate.  Mika felt rejected because she knew he wanted a werewolf for a mate.  She was angry at Grady for various ""assumed"" reasons.  The major conflict causing her to leave was based on hearing Grady talk about someone else and thinking he was talking about her.  When Grady tried to explain she refused to listen.  In fact she threatened him with something if he even talked to her.  Thus he was forced to be quiet and not explain anything.  This was such a cheap device to extend the conflict I was angry.  It overshadowed the good writing from earlier in the book and I had to lower the stars.  There was an odd scene near the end with Grady's brother wanting Mika.  I wasn't sure if this was true or if he was trying to make Grady jealous.  That felt thrown in and not developed enough by the author.I would have preferred the author show how Grady's feelings change during the book.  We don't see how or why he fell in love with Mika.  We do know he didn't want her in the beginning - other than for sex.The sex scenes were pretty good.  There were a lot of them.DATA:Ebook story length: about 3  hours.

I don't care how much of a genius someone is, Radio Shack is not the be-all/end-all of electronic components. If the author had just said something like, {He started scouring websites to find the parts needed} I think it would have been more believable.As to the story itself once the two men are in the past, I really enjoyed it. I liked how their ""planning"" wasn't quite perfect all of the time, and they would have to come up with new parts to their plans or change the plans a bit to cover unknown situations.

People tend to visit Orlando, then come to St. Augustine with visions of the 'magical' world and unfortunately think Castillo de San Marcos was a replica of 'a castle' built only for their enjoyment.

Partly for that reason, I have decided to post this review.  I use other readers' reviews to help me choose books.  I always read the best and the worst that is written before making a purchase.  I normally find that after reading a book, I don't agree with the negative reviews.  In this case I do agree.I really disliked this book.  I did not find the humor humorous, and the story just seemed to plod along.  I'm not sure the main character is intelligent enough to solve a mystery.  After two or three chapters, I really didn't care if the mystery was solved or not.There are many types of humor, and I am sure that this style will appeal to some readers.  I also look for a plot that really catches my attention in the first chapter, or an appealing character.  I did not find either in this book.  Since I read for enjoyment, I wasn't interested in seeing if the pace of the story picked up later in the book.If you are looking for mysteries set in the medieval period, read  Ellis Peters' Cadfael series.  They were written some time ago and the author is deceased, but the books are still great.  I was greatly disappointed in the television production of her books.

There is sure to be lots of sexual tension and participation, right?  WRONG!  There should be some kind of sticker put on the back of this book: WARNING - may contain highly emotional content that may not be suitable for all readers.  Oh sure, Shiloh Walker tells you AT THE END of the book, but at that point you are already read the emotionally hard parts.Playing for Keeps starts out as a story about three people: Dana, the free spirited woman looking for commitment-free fun, Mason, the current lover that provides the fun, and Jake, the love torn on-again-off-again boyfriend of the woman he loves that flees at the hint of relationship-related seriousness.  Mason is an excuse in this book, so for the most part it is all about Jake and Dana.  The book starts off with Jake sharing Dana with another man; the only way he is able to be with Dana without her freaking out.  It moves along to just Dana and Jake when they find out they are going to be surprise parents.  Then, unfortunately, moves into a terrible tragedy that threatens their fledgling relationship.  Can their love survive?Jake is like a lovesick puppy, following around the object of his desire over the course of years.  When he does get the chance to snag Dana, he grabs on with both hands.  There is not a lot of seething rage toward the man that he must share his love with.  Don't get me wrong, he hates Mason, but he wants Dana happy more and the m&eacute;nage relationship makes her so.  When he finds out that she is pregnant, he steps up to the plate and takes responsibility.  Good man.  I really liked the realism that Jake gives off.  I like seeing him respond with Dana's wishes in mind, instead of just his own.Dana, on the other hand, likes to play.  She is not the type of woman that thinks about settling down and starting a family as being her top priority.  So when news of an unexpected baby arrives, she is forced to reevaluate her life.  And when her heart is heavy with loss, she discovers what is truly important to her.  It was nice to see the growth bloom within Dana's character.  Even though the story itself is rather on the skimpy side of size, nothing about any of the character's developments seems rushed.***SPOILER ALERT***Now let's move to the part that I warned you about earlier.  The loss of an unborn child is tremendous.  You do not have to hold the baby in your arms to love it and feel the weight of their loss.  From personal experience, the sadness does not ever go away, just lessens enough for you to function.  Sad to say that in this type of tragedy, sometimes the men are overlooked in terms of grief.  Most relationships do not last after losing a child; either parent cannot deal with their grief or that of their partner's.  But there are some that grow closer in the aftermath.  Ms. Walker and I are two such cases.  I applaud her in sharing the story of her and her husband's  own experience with her readers, no matter how much it hurt personally to read and experience these events all over again.  And though I am happy with the ending of this book, I most likely will not re-read it anytime soon.***END SPOILER***Shiloh Walker is known for her dramatic prose and hard/dark themes.  Her writing will touch you, no matter your circumstances, long after the book is done.  I highly recommend any of her many stories, from her contemporary romances, to the paranormal and erotic.  But I, again, warn you that this one in particular can be an emotional roller coaster.  If you start crying, don't say that I didn't tell you ahead of time.FTC Advisory: The author provided me with a copy of Playing for Keeps.

I read a lot of books, way too many to do reviews for all of them, so I generally only write reviews if they were exceptionally good or really bad.  I don't want to take the time to review an average book.  And this one should have been average.  It reminded me of an 80's Harlequin, with Yanis, rich and powerful, dominating Lee throughout most of the book.  I was ok with that because I was in the mood for a ""mean"" hero and I thought the storyline flowed pretty well.  I noticed in reviews of her other books that people complained about grammatical errors.  There were plenty of those, but if the story is good enough I don't mind overlooking them.What I couldn't overlook was the overuse of the word ""had"".  By the middle of the book it was to the point that I couldn't even concentrate on the story because ""had"" kept jumping out at me.  Sometimes several in one sentence.  Out of curiosity I counted them once and there were 16 just on one page.  So I basically just skimmed the last half of the book because it was too painful plowing through the ""hads"".

At one point he finds a teenage girl on the beach who is exceedingly drunk.  So drunk that he takes her to his home and puts her to bed twice changing her clothes and she being naked.  Then we zoom back to the present day where  he knocks up his girlfriend and the rest of the first book is all about arguing both sides of the abortion/pro-life/pro-choice issue. As we read about the issue(s) involved this guy gets shot at and delivered a package of blood and tissue representative of an aborted fetus.  At no time does he ever call the police.  He calls his drinking buddy.  The drunk teenage girl disappears and her mother comes to this guy requesting that he find her.  He has pissed off the pregnant girlfriend who tosses him out on his ear, and the missing teen is killed in a traffic accident,  so he decides to go undercover as a humble hayseed who travels to where the girl was killed to get the real story. Things that make you go hmmmmmmm.Now we are at book two where humble hayseed gets himself hired as a handyman at a convent where something shady is going on.  The convent just happens to take care of pregnant teens and a mysterious black limo appears at night and pregnant teens give birth but their babies seem to disappear.  I'm sure you can figure out the rest.The book(s) isn't awful, but the author appears to have written two different books -- one that needed a beginning and one that needed an ending so he stuck them together and voila.And although I have no problem with stretching the believability scale when reading fiction, I gotta tell ya I don't believe a man is going to pick a drunk out of her gourd teenage girl and have her naked twice in his bed but nothing happens.

Meeting Lissa knocks him out of his ennui once he's awakened to an all encompassing love.  Could she be the One he's searched for?  Once it's learned that the accident was no accident, Atticus does everything in his power to ensure that Lissa stays alive long enough for them to explore all the possibilities.Most of the vampire novels I tend to steer towards are usually dark, violent, brutal and brimming with lurid sex (think JR Ward), which makes them not quite as emotionally romantic as One and Only.  This delightfully sweet paranormal romance carried an ""R in Romantic"" timeless vibe.  Sure the sex is sensual, at times even naughty, but the amiable warmth here is old school.  It's not in the bodice ripper class; there's definitely violin and piano music serenading reader heartstrings.Atticus is noble and honorable with that air of Byronic tragedy that makes him vulnerable without being a stuffy wimp.  When he opens his heart and life to the equally lonely and engaging Lissa, I was so glad they finally found one another.  There's a tender thread throughout that works well with themes of friendship, loyalty, and hope, as well as the continuing battle of good vs. evil.

Determined to gain entrance to the club and maybe one day even into the ranks of the undead, Nissa finally makes a contact that gets her invited.On her fist night at the club, Nissa is intent of full-filling her most darkest fantasies - and the Midnight Playground is just the place to do so.

However when I got to the end and it seemed the three very characters that made the book interesting, well, were less for the story, I was disappointed.It is an excellent first book to build on a universe, and launch the series though. Well written, and as I said engaging. It conveyed the excitement of testing the first FTL drive of humanity well. Then first contact with aliens was as exciting as one might imagine. Full of hope, then everything goes south. While overall in the end the universe is better for it, the three people I investing interest in the story were in worse shape at the end than the beginning.I was unsurprised by the way the author went with the AI at the end, its the trend it seems. Technically Anita may have been better off, but this is not a feel good ending kind of story.

5954,B002VFPS4U,"[5, 5]",5,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 8/10PROS:- Ian and Nicky's past together is revealed in just enough detail early on that it made me instantly curious to read more about them.- I love the fact that Ian is not physically perfect. The author examines his thoughts and feelings (both mental and physical) pertaining to his amputated arm in a good amount of detail. His musings about it are pervasive, but I didn't find them annoying; they're reflective and a little sad, but he's not overly despairing or dramatic about it.- I also liked that Nicky is just the slightest bit on the standoffish side when it comes to Ian, yet he's also the aggressor in their relationship.- I've read quite a few Regency romances over the years, both m/f and m/m, but the characters in this story participate in some holiday festivities and games that I'd never read about before and that give the story a fun, unique feel.- The ending of the novella contains an unusual plot twist that I liked a lot. (I don't want to say more because I'm afraid I'll give something away.)CONS:- Mitchell uses occasional foreign phrases throughout the story, and I must admit to my ignorance of the meaning of some of them, which made certain sentences basically incomprehensible to me. For example: ""As injurious as this fortnight was to Ian's mens sana, it was a boon to his corpore sano.""- There are a couple (but only a couple) conversations that contained fewer speech tags (""he said"") than I wanted; that is, I was confused for a short time as to who was speaking, what the characters' relationship was, who the people being referred to were, etc. The first of these conversations is at the very beginning of the story.Overall comments: My one main complaint about this story is that it's short; that's not to say that it's TOO short, though. I just didn't want it to end. I loved the treatment of Ian's disability, especially how gentle and reassuring Nicky is without emasculating Ian at all. The sex isn't terribly graphic, but there's a decent amount of it.","09 2, 2010",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T. Anchor,1283385600

Yet it develops the theme of overcoming old wounds which is one I particularly love to read.  I picked it up after reading and liking another book of hers, His Majesty Prince of Toads.The fun premise is a magical brew (a love potion)that is causing all the bachelor's to marry. The Earl of Vailmont doesn't believe the rumors, however, and is determined to prove his theory that there is no magic involved. In typical rouge fashion, he sets out to show his friends that he can associate with women without getting caught. Unfortunately, he chooses Sylvia to experiment with and becomes attracted to her. This pits Val against Sylvia in a game of pursuit as old as time.You can read this for the fun, surface story of magical love potions, lusty protagonists, and fears of marriage and really enjoy this book. You can also read this for the underlying story where both Val and Sylvia have suffered  great losses--loss that has always stood in the way of true happiness and finding love. Though they each approach their losses--betrayal, moral dilemmas, death, in different ways it is that approach and that desire to find love that is for me the real conflict in this story and what puts it above many others in this genre.","11 28, 2010",A1PMYWK6CVJJNI,MaggieMae,1290902400

(a person can dream, can't they?)I was especially pleased when an early scenario came to a satisfying, timely resolution.  I looked forward to enjoying the rest of a fast paced read.Sadly, this wasn't meant to be.  The last 2/3 of the book could have been told in half the time.  The story started to drag and meander.  The reader can see where the book is going, but it takes such a long, round-about way to get there that I found myself skimming trying to get to the inevitable conclusion.Two other negative points were: 1) It was difficult to get in the government's corner over the root issue.  Without giving anything away, I could definitely see the terrorist's point when it came to their outrage against the U.S.2) The suspense of this book took a hit when it became apparent that the only truly 'together' group in this tale was the mafia portion.  Neither the government agencies nor the terrorist group were very bright or formidable.  Some of the passages were truly cringe worthy.A HUGE turn off for me was the inclusion of a romantic twist.  I absolutely HATE that.  I would love to find a well written mystery/ thriller that does not pander to the unnecessary tendency to include a love story.To me, nothing weakens a thriller like having some soppy mess thrown in just to satisfy...what?  I don't even know.  It's completely ridiculous.  In this tale you have agents navigating the woods in search of a terrorist stronghold.  These are supposedly the 'best of the best' and the situation is of dire national importance.  So what does the author do?  He throws in romantic schlock so that two of the agents can become distracted and waste the reader's time with idiotic inner musings.  The middle of a life and death situation is not the time for that crap.  It's a cheap device and I abhor authors who employ it.Along that same vein, I quickly became tired of the protagonist's wife whining about his job and its effect on their marriage.  She knew it going in, but takes every opportunity to make him feel guilty...even in the midst of a terrible national crisis.Perhaps the subsequent books in this series are better.  This one, however, seems disjointed and covers too much ground to be plausible or enjoyable.I would hesitate to read another book in this series because this one was so difficult to slog through until the end.","06 3, 2014",AFAIEJL65GKRK,DeeDee Brown,1401753600

To be honest, I stopped reading halfway through the book. It began slow and remained a slow, uninteresting read.  It lacked passion; not making love passion, but passion for life. Neither Jada or Aaron were interesting characters and the story was too, too `everything is perfect'.  Everybody is just so understanding and accommodating--the bit of drama with his father and her grandmother was blah.  To give an example of what I mean (and there are MANY), Aaron finally finds out almost  half way into the book that he fathered a child 5 years ago--keep in mind that Aaron and Jada kept in contact for a few months after he left and she never mentioned to him that she was pregnant. When she finally tells him he has a son, Aaron becomes overwhelmed with emotions (misty eyed) knowing that he's a father. WTH!  I think most men would be upset/angry to know that they had a child and the woman they love never told them! Not in this book; it's all good--all is well; NO PASSION.  OMG, don't let me get started on the scene when father and son finally meet. It was so over the top, it made me want to barf. Maybe if this scene had been towards the beginning of the book, it would have been touching. In the middle of the book after just too much blah it made me thrown down my kindle.  It was like eating a sweet dessert that was so sweet it made your teeth hurt. This book had a good theme, but no follow-through. Also, if we're to believe that Jada graduated from Harvard, then let it be reflected in her speech and her job. We're told that she has this wonderful personality which caused Aaron to fall in love with her--never saw it. If the author had described her as depressed and foolish--Yes! I would believe it in a heartbeat. She was boring. This book was so frustrating to read.  I truly struggled to read it as far as I did.

8927,B002RKSZJO,"[1, 1]",5,"My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne?  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work.  It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism.  With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook.  Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may.  The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste.  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the `science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the ""speculative"" portion to explore human nature.  Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this.  And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost.  However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well.  We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions.  The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed.  Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular ""twenty thousand leagues"" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks.  There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly.  Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base.  Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as ""inoffensive creature[s],"" he gleefully slaughters a herd of ""cruel, mischievous"" sperm whales.  Hardly sustainability at its best.  But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology.  Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design).  Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented.  Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by ""foul air.""Verne wrote at an exciting time.  The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid.  We were just beginning to understand electricity.  The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered.  Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon.  There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion.  Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given.  It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword.  I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968.  It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would).  These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel.  It also contains a ""backword"" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine.","11 22, 2011",A1LW3XGXYP98BW,H. Pace,1321920000

From the clumsy dialog to the sloppy plot line to the incredibly bad writing this book was a failure.  For example, there is a point at which the protagonist is helping someone up.  The prose reads something like ""Jonathan reached out his hand and Jonathan took it.""  I am not kidding.  Now, that may be slightly paraphrased, but the essentials are there.  For example, there is a battle in an office building where the police are getting absolutely creamed.  Do they stop and regroup?  Does anybody say ""these tactics are not working?""  Nope.  They continue fighting using the old methods until practically everyone is dead.These same mistakes are made over and over and over again in this novel.  I will say that those few snippets about the Christian Faith that Mr. Somers shared were pretty spot on, even if clumsily delivered, but that's about as far as I am willing to go to provide praise for this book.  If you are bored silly, and for some reason absolutely nothing else is available and if you can get this book for free, then go ahead and read it.  Otherwise spend your money on something else.  C. S. Lewis' space trilogy is a better choice, or perhaps Kathy Tyers' Firebird trilogy if you can find it.

When the high school's resident mean girl turns up dead no one is quite sure where to look. The high school sweetheart? The lovestruck friend? Or is it someone completely unexpected? In any case expect a good dollop of witchcraft and slight hints at romance.Overall I really liked the series. There's one or two things that could be changed, most noticably the romantic triangle. It's painfully obvious that Marcus is interested in Maggie (and not dating Liss). It's even more obvious that Tom is not right for Maggie- their romantic scenes just come across as awkward and the reader can't help but wonder when Maggie will realize that she's dating the male equivalent of her mother & sister. For that matter I can't help but wonder if this is all going to pay off in a future book when Maggie FINALLY realizes that she can be her own person without running away or alienating her family. (I.E., her breaking it off with Tom is the defining moment when she realizes that she doesn't have to put up with people telling her how she should live her life or being condescending.) That's pretty much the only big thing that is flawed so far in the series. I know that Alt's probably saving it for some big scene later on in the series, but I can't help but get a little frustrated and impatient. It's just a bit tedious. In any case Alt needs to trim the dead weight (Tom) out of the series & either make him less condescending (making him a more believable romantic possibility) or downgrade him to an occasional character.4.8/5","12 19, 2008",A2XNOB1T796Y6B,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""",1229644800

Ropars seems to have a clear respect for the history of horror, which should translate into a passion for the genre.  None of that passion, however, makes it into the story.A young woman, Crow Lee, is awoken from a bizarre dream by a sudden sound.  At first she thinks the sound is an earthquake, then she thinks it is a plane crash.  As she logs on to her social networking sites and turns on the news, the truth turns out to be something even more unsettling -- a meteor has struck downtown Chicago and it is having a strange effect on dead bodies.  Crow finds herself having to fight her away out of her high rise apartment building with only the weapons she has on hand.Ropars states that his intention was to place strong women in classic horror situations.  The problem with this story is that the situation was a little too classic -- Crow is surrounded by stock 1960s-style zombies, right down to their muttered pleas for ""brainsssss.""  I wish he had put a bit more of his creative energy into the scenes -- some innovation would have gone a long way.Fans of strong female characters who don't mind a standard situation will still find a lot to enjoy in this story.

Childhood pains are delved into, including dealing with her religion.

I was sadly disappointed that very little is discussed about the church.

It's premise is one character has intimate dreams about a person and place for two years until he finally finds the house and the man that lives there.  Supposedly the house is alive and drew him there because of the sadness of the man that lived there and the fact he was letting the house fall apart by not keeping it up.  Mostly the book is angst and sex with a small story thrown in to tie it together.  I would have not liked Marek the guy that lived in the house at all. He was a whiny needy jerk.

Novels take more skill than might appear--developing characters the reader can like or dislike, or in some way find interesting enough to continue turning the page. As I recall, she doesn't particularly excell in the long form. I gave this work a try, hopinng Eloisa James's forte might be in the shorter work.  While it is difficult to develop characters much in the time and space contraints of the novella, one would hope for interesting characters, at least.  Ms. James has fallen to the temptation of crafting paper doll characters: all rather shallow and incredible extremes.  The husband is rough and evil, but not entirely so.  His successor is suave and courteous, but not particularly so.  The protagonist (there are actually two and a half) is a man who apparently has grown and changed very little from boy to man, yet we are supposed to root for him.  The heroine has changed not at all from girl to wife to widow.  She is simply confused and lustful.

If I remember correctly, the story was touted as an erotic romance. But what it really read like was a prequel teaser, or maybe a prologue for a much more in-depth novel. The reader is literally dropped into the middle of a fairly complicated political scenario. The narrator, Dardanus, is an advisor to the lonely Queen Nestra. Since he is a ""bastard"", Dardanus can never assume what he believes is his rightful position as king. His plan is to seduce the Queen, convince her to remove her magical medallion (whose magic is never explained), then kill her.The chemistry between the two characters is nice, though short-lived. When the two finally make it to the bed, it's nothing to write home about. One page. Yep, one page of implied copulation. In fact, the most fun I've had with this is coming up with the phrase ""implied copulation."" Whee. (said with a sad face) OH, and Dardanus slaps Nestra. And not in a playful, naughty way, but in a ""Say yes, b*tch"" way. Look, I'm all for fun and games or whatever, but that kind of pissed me off.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in this series and this book did not disappointDylan Gennaro is a werewolf who's been alone for most of the last 10 years. He knows from previous experience that getting involved with anyone only leads to them getting hurt, literally. After a desperate escape from Alan Matthews, his former ruthless pack Alpha, Dylan just wants to fix up a house and live peacefully in Red Rock.Sasha Wallace is a witch. Her mentor was killed by Matthews because Matthews wanted Sasha for himself. Before she was rescued however, Matthews inflicted scars both physical and mental, and those take a long time to heal. Sasha knows things could have been much worse and feels she owes a debt to the Red Rock Pack for rescuing her.When a werewolf comes back into town showing evidence of a vampire attack, the Red Rock Alpha decides to send Dylan and Sasha to Maine to call in a debt from a friend - a vampire friend. While Dylan and Sasha meet with the vampire, their pack-mates, Joe and Brynn, are tasked with checking out the local werewolf pack, as there have been hints of trouble. Little do they know what kind of trouble is waiting for them. I liked the fact that we get to see how Brynn is progressing since the end of Sanctuary Lost. Her situation was fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time.Dylan and Sasha' story was sweet and sexy. They both had issues to work through as a result of being under Alan Matthew's ""rule"" and I like that Moira Rogers didn't sugarcoat their issues and go straight to a HEA. Their insecurities were realistic and the potential conflicts resulting from their issues made for believable characters. Dylan is not Alpha but his werewolf instincts were very, very sexy. When Dylan tells Sasha, ""I'm not like the alphas. I don't want your submission. I just want your pleasure."", I almost melted.

The only complaint was that there was a lot of detail put into all the different mechanisms they had to make. However, it was still interesting to learn such things from the way to build many things from raw resources to how to create makeshift items to help with survival.The story begins with 5 prisoners; an engineer, a sailor, a reporter, a servant, and a young man along with a very bright dog; traveling in a hot air balloon to escape imprisonment during the Civil War. They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by. They even go on a short trip to a close but un-useful island to help a castaway. For four long years these escapees have to start from nothing to make themselves a civilized dwelling. They create everything from a house in granite rock and a garden and an animal farm to any mechanism they might need to create something to survive with. They spend their days working and building and creating all the necessities as well as some wants. They build two ships and at the last second when they fear death, they are saved. There are references to 20,000 leagues under the seas and captain Nemo as well as historical things.The story is long but with all the details you learn not only to feel like you know the islanders but also enough to see their surroundings and feel their anxieties. There is adventure, camaraderie, pirates, survival, and many other things all wrapped up in this amazing classic.","03 7, 2010",AN8ELR6AHMMQ,"Jessss ""I read to find stories that inspire m...",1267920000

She had a car accident, that does not make you less of a woman because you think you cannot have children. I think the hero, when he first decided to go for the heroine, seemed like he was playing with her for his own amusement. I would SERIOUSLY have thought this if I did not get his insight for a brief time or if he was not so caring at the very beginning. I am pretty sure he did not sleep with another woman since he met the heroine because he talks about cold showers over the months A LOT, even though he did go to events with other women. He just put her into the role of his wife and hostess without telling her ANYTHING and expected her to just know how he felt about her. Well here is a newsflash, telling the heroine that you have wanted her from the beginning sexually does not tell her you want to marry her. The heroine also changed COMPLETELY from the beginning to the end. She was a scared, easily intimidated woman at the start and goes to being a seductive, vixen type at the end. It was weird to see her change so much in such a short period of time because of a guy's attention. I am not sure what the purpose of his friends on the yacht were. They did not have a significance with ANY decisions the hero and heroine made and they barely talked. It was all just annoying.

Could have been fun, but the author seems to have strung together a number of separately written sections, while forgetting what happened in the previous sections!  Its nuts, i.e. characters show up injured but no injury was ever described, characters jump from one location to another with no connection, and there seems to be no point to any of it.Very poor writing, even worse editing (does this author even have an editor?).  Mayer needs to clean up his writing, and get it edited.  In addition, his plot is rather thin, and if he's going to go for the outlandish, at least make it a little believable.But my biggest complaint about the book is that it isn't even exciting or particularly interesting. This is no thriller, in fact it drags along so slowly, and fails to grip the reader to such a degree it is actually quite boring and laborious to plod through.Update: After reading the book, the ending was fairly good and some action sequences just prior to the ending were't so bad. So, I'm upgrading the book from one star and making it two stars.

Sean isn&#8217;t her boyfriend, he&#8217;s her boss. Now she has to reveal the lie she&#8217;s been telling her family for the past two years or hastily concoct an elaborate ruse to fool them instead.When Macy tells Sean Mathis of her predicament he does what any gentleman would &#8211; he laughs and then agrees to help her out. Little does he know that one misplaced word in their little scheme will backfire and land them both in the hot-seat.Secluded in the mountains, surrounded by snow and good will, Sean and Macy can&#8217;t help looking like the perfect couple. So perfect that the family decides a Christmas wedding will make it a holiday none of them would ever forget!I must say that I only chose to read this book because a) I wanted a light holiday read and b) I needed to read a book with a book with a Christmas tree on the cover for a reading challenge.  It was also a freebie from Amazon and I usually go into the freebies with a little bit of caution because, at least in my experience, they typically aren't as well written as books that cost money.  It was also a novella, which is a hard genre to write because you have so little space to fully develop both the characters and theme.  BUT, even though it seemed to have so much going against it the author really seemed to prove herself as a good author.  I immediately felt a connection to Macy and Sean, the main characters of the book, and felt like the plotline, for the most part, could be something that would really happen.  I definitely didn't constantly spend time thinking &#34;There is no way that this could happen.&#34; which added to the books readability.  I liked the story line.  It was sweet and had a little bit of spice which was just what I was looking for when I chose this book.  I also think the Graison did a great job moving the story along at a good pace and was able to write enough and kept it from lacking holes in the plot.  When I was done with the it, I felt like I had read an entire book even though it was a novella.  That is a tough job, given the allotment space, and like I said earlier the author did an excellent job delivering an entire, fully developed story in less than 200 pages.The only thing that I would complain about the plot would be how the story ended.  I don't want to say anything specifics and avoid spoilers, but it just didn't ring true.  If anything, I would rather see a different ending with another novella to make it a series.  After reading the story as it is, I still wish there was more information on what happened to the character after the ending.All in all, I liked the book and would recommend it to someone looking for a light holiday read.  It was cute and reminded me of a Hallmark Holiday movie.  I don't say this to cut the book down.  I say this because this was what I was looking for and I found it in Blame it on the Mistletoe.  4 stars.","12 14, 2013",A19GP20DYUOKVW,"Regina Niesen ""Gina""",1386979200

Scalable font.  The pictures were a bit wasted on the six inch screen but they were nice to have on the PC app.  All in all formatting is a 4.5 out of 5, the half star being deducted for the lack of chapter links.Content:  I enjoyed meeting Dr. Thorndyke and Dr. Jervis but I didn't get as attached to them as to, say, Poirot or Miss Marple or Sherlock Holmes.  There was much less of ""them"" present in the works... although the fact that Dr. Thorndyke never quite figured out how inept Dr. Jervis was grated a little... maybe I am too used to watching Poirot and Holmes watch indulgently as Hastings and Watson bumble along to believe anyone could be blind to his inadequacies.  The mysteries themselves were generally pretty decent, and the detective work was quite interesting.  Of the three long tales one of the three was incredibly predictable, and two of the three were moderately predictable.  The short stories were far more enjoyable although they were also mostly predictable.  They were fun and kept me reading more so than the novels did.  If I had to guess at the goal of the author just from these four works I would have to say that he was trying to illustrate new methods of detection and problem solving in an entertaining way much more than he was trying to tell stories about interesting characters.

5705,B000GFK7L6,"[7, 8]",5,"When I first got my Kindle, one of the first things I did was take advantage of the 30 trial and subscribe to the NYT. At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.","12 8, 2010",A30YCQ4MOZAI6Y,Michelle R,1291766400

However, this story took a horrible turn into the unbelieveable when it went extreme paranormal and then never really elaborated on it. There was already the special ancient abilities in the Grayhawk family their really didn't need to be more. It didn't add to the story it only took away from it.The hero, Peyton, was totally different than he was in the other books of the series. In the other books he was charming, fun, reliable and in this one he was whiny and selfish. What he does to Cam is really messed up. I could've gotten past it but then he kept whining about it. I wanted to jump into the book and say ""man up!"" And don't get me started on the heroine, Avantae. She was a selfish, spineless, nymphomaniac. All she kept trying to do is get Peyton even though it would ruin his relationship with Cam. Clearly, she learned nothing from her previous lifes mistakes. She pretended to care how Cam felt but she didn't care. Then when she should have put her foot down and stood up for herself she let everyone just lead her around and make decisions for her.All the women of this series are all the same. They don't object to anything, the don't stand up for themselves, they have no self-esteem, they have to be willing to give up everything they are for these men, they have to be willing to come last when it comes to the Grayhawk family and the only thing they can expect to get from their so called ""loves"" is frequent sex, but God forbid they have any desire to be put first at any point. The men sacrifice nothing for these women the women do all the bending, all the waiting, all the being patient, all the understanding and if they ever complain along comes one of the Grayhawk siblings to tell them how beneath their family they are and how lucky they should feel that one of the Grayhawk men even looked their way so they better just accept however they're getting treated or they won't be treated at all. What the women want doesn't matter to the Grayhawk men.And talk about needing their egos stroked. This Grayhawk family need to leave the women of the world alone and just be with each other. All they want is someone to stroke their ego for them. If I had to read about how amazing one of them were again I would have thrown up. It was a little over kill on the Hawk-you're-so-great train. It was so repetitive ""No, you're the best"" ""No, you're the best"" ""No, your better than I am"" ""Oh, no, I'm nothing compared to you, Hawk,"" man, it got bad.The sad thing is I actually like the author. Her book Skin Deep was excellent I loved it, but this series needs emotionally stronger women and a little more give on the male leads part. I'm all for Alpha male but these guys don't care at all for their women. The women add nothing to their lives accept for one more person to toot their horn and are little more than glorified sex toys. All in all I'm giving up on this series but not on the author because she does have the ability to tell a good balanced story, but this series just isn't it.","01 31, 2011",A26SG61U07YZ3U,W.

Fortunately for her, the United Wish Federation keeps exceptional video records, and when her UWF agent shows up to grant her wish, a disbelieving Mariah is given proof even she can't deny.That still doesn't mean she remembers her wish.It's only with her friend's help that her memory is jogged. And when it is, it's hard to believe she'd ever wish for anything else. Six years ago she'd had a magical night with a young guy named I.C. Tucker. It was the best night of her life and Tucker had fueled her hottest fantasies ever since. She would love another chance with the now famous professional poker player.When her newest client turns out to be the soon-to-be-married bride of Tucker's best friend, and Mariah comes face to face with Tucker again after six long years, Mariah realizes two things. One, the man still draws her on every level, and two...her wish has been granted. And Mariah has no intention of letting the opportunity go to waste.Problem is, their connection is so intense and her emotions so quickly involved, that having their entire relationship based on nothing but some silly wish - something with a definitive expiration date - no longer appeals. Mariah wants a happily ever after with the man of her dreams...and hottest fantasies. To get that, though, she'll have to do the one thing that may push Tucker away from her forever.~*~So this is what you get when you take a little magic and a little chocolate, add a dash of humor and a bunch of hot sex, and stir with a surprising depth of emotional connection. Wow!All Inis an erotic PNR novella that thoroughly satisfies.Lately the most consistent issue I've had with the romances I've been reading is that too many are plenty heavy on the lust but not so big on the deeper interpersonal relationships and downright light on love, with entire relationships based solely on the horizontal...or vertical....or upside down, for the kinksters out there...mambo. And I'm not talking about the erotic romances, either. So to actually read an erotic romance that manages to blend the hot sex with a solid romance between two likable characters quite obviously made for each other was a special treat that I won't soon forget.There's plenty of hot sex, sure, but I adored how Willoughby had a plausible backstory for her characters that laid the groundwork for the romance that developed, so it didn't feel unrealistically fast when the relationship start getting emotionally significant for the characters. Mariah and Tucker were wonderfully into each other for more than just physical pleasure, and that romance is as sweet as the chocolate delicacies Mariah sells. It's a great balance.The paranormal elements were fun. Davina was a hoot and she stole every scene she was in. I didn't buy how quickly Mariah wrapped her mind around the whole wish granting thing, though, even with the proof she got (which was awesome in its own right), and I found Tucker's reactions later in the book to be even more of a stretch. Those were minor grievances, however, when compared to the strength of the rest of the story and my appreciation for an erotic romance that gave as much attention to the ""romance"" as it did the ""erotic."" I liked this one a lot.Disclosure: A copy of this novella was provided to me by the author for an honest review.

I discovered Frank on the Kindle Discussion boards and his posts were so hilarious that I just had to try his books. If you haven't read his blog, be warned: Do not have a beverage near your computer when you read the entry about the lawnmower.That said, I read Dead Man's Rain first and had so many questions that I emailed Frank. What's a Jerk? Which war was this, where is this set, etc. Silly me, still forgetting that this is a fantasy. I missed out on a lot of the background by not reading The Mister Trophy first, so if you're reading this and haven't read any of the other Markhat series yet, definitely start with this one. He answered me right away. But you can save yourself the embarrassment of having to be told, in the nicest possible way, ""It's all a fantasy, I made it up"". I would have gotten that immediately if I had read the books in order.To paraphrase one of the best lines from the book, a troll should never smile at someone he likes. I almost dropped my Kindle.The Misters are trolls. These are not your cutesy little bridge trolls (or even the ones who hang out on discussion boards), that would be too easy. These are big, scary, long-fanged, gargly-voiced trolls with translation spells, definitely not adorable.Markhat is a 'finder', Tuttle-speak for Private Eye. He's also a smart aleck and as entertaining as protaganists get. The book is short, but that's okay, there are three more to read, soon to be four.The Markhat world also features vampires, aka the half-dead, ogres, Mamma Hog, a reader who mothers - and puts hexes on - the sometimes reckless Markhat.All of this sounded silly to me when I read the description, but Frank manages to take all this insanity and turn it into a wildly entertaining read.Start with this one and keep on going...they just keep getting better! The price is right and even if you've never liked fantasy novels before (I hadn't), you'll love these.","06 12, 2010",A33REC3J2JU2EL,D. Figueroa,1276300800

As another reviewer said, all the problems in the book were ""solved"" by having sex.  The sex scenes were good, if a little corny at times, (really, having sex while he sprouts wings and levitates them above the bed?!).  That's about the only thing this book was good for.  The author's descriptions of anything except the sex scenes were poor, (I never even felt like there was a decent description of what the dragon form looked like).  And the heroine was incredibly foolish and weak, repeatedly getting herself into scrapes he has to save her from.  I HATE stories with weak women constantly in need of rescue.Amazon needs to introduce a refund program, so you can get at least some of your money back for bad purchases.

They started out in Atlanta, but when she realized she was falling in love with him, she decided it was time for a change and headed to the Mirage Agency in DC. Shortly thereafter, Milo was offered a job at the same agency and he accepted the offer and now they are working together again, which is slowly driving Mya insane as she is lusting after him. What she doesn't realize, is that Milo is having the same issues.The tension culminates to a head when the two place a highly sexual bet over an account which results in a weekend full of incredible passion. Milo is trying to figure out how to expand the weekend into much more, but Mya doesn't realize where his head is, and is worried about losing her heart and her friend.This is a hot little book with tons of really passionate loving. These two are best friends, but neither one realizes what the other is thinking which created the tension for the book. I like that they have a highly competitive relationship at work.

The story, as told from the cat itself was incredible, well written, and totally believable. I have owned several cats in my life, all of which I loved, and should have treated better, and this book reminded me of them.This book tell the story of one cat, the main character in the story. It is not a fairy tale, it tells it like it is. I think even it tells it better than the fate of many cats who are used even today for animal testing. It has some good spots, and some truly sad parts that will make you cry.The book has left me very emotional, as it will do to anyone with a heart, not just cat lovers. This book is a stand out book, which stands above those I have reviewed elsewhere on Amazon. If I could give it 6 stars I would, because it truly deserves that.

So after setting the scene, we're skipped ahead decades.The plot itself, we're told, is based on a true story.  It's one of those things that you might hear of happening to a friend of a friend of a friend -- a woman smells roses if somebody in her family is about to die.  But this wasn't enough and we get two other supernatural elements that are played out in great detail and then never explained.It's less thrilling than it is sophoric.  The reader keeps waiting for details to be explained or come together to create a cohesive whole, but it never happens.","04 1, 2013",A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,morehumanthanhuman,1364774400

11534,B002A4MIDQ,"[17, 19]",5,"I really looked forward to enjoying another one of Dana Marie Bells' book since reading all of the Halle Puma & Shifter series several times over because they were that good.  Unfortunately, this book was a huge disappointment - I had to force myself to finish it.  Many times I stopped reading, went on to another book that I actually enjoyed and then forced myself to go back to it with the hope that it would improve to only be more disappointed.  I just could not get interested in the story or characters.The main characters, Kiran and Logan are really the Norse Gods, Loki and Baldur.  A major problem for me in the first half of the book was that I simply could not keep straight which character was which god and had what supernatural powers.  I have read Federal Tax Laws that were clearer.  While the Norse Gods concept was unique, it was also very confusing to the reader unless one was very knowledgeable about Norse mythology in the first place.  The Norse mythology was also a little too much for such a short novel because it forced the author to find a way to introduce the different Norse Gods, their different powers and relationship to each other which just led to MAJOR bewilderment.  Many times things were not clear until much later in the book when the reader was fed a little more background on the Norse mythology which then made a much prior passage make sense, somewhat, sometimes.  The story might be interesting if reread after a ""cheat sheet"" concerning Norse mythology is made by the reader but quite frankly I still do not think I would be any more interested in the characters or story than I was the first time around.As for the ""hot sex"" scenes that another reviewer mentioned - maybe explicit but that did not make them ""hot"".  To me, the scenes were more of a ""throw in"" because that's what is expected in a book that is supposed to be an erotic romance and I had long stop caring whether there was any romance between the characters.Note to Author:  Please Dana - return back to the Halle Shifter series and let this series stay in the past like Norse mythology.","11 24, 2010",AYZ3XI8VSE6C1,Rare Reviewer,1290556800

7584,B00371V7WO,"[0, 1]",5,"I didn't finish this book, got bored hence the default 1* rating. Poorly written, not enough detail, gaping plot holes, and tedious.I'm not sure what category to put this in - this story is- NOT erotica (As some reviewers have pointed out. Not enough sexual tension etc);- NOT SciFi; far too unimaginative and unsophisticated;- NOT well written enough or engrossing to be a good story- hence may be it's geared towards the tender romance variety? But I didn't feel any chemistry for that either.Overall, perhaps it's just a little bit of the above genres but not enough to be any of thoseI like books that capture my interests. There are some books that require one to read a good few chapters before one is engrossed. Due to the gaping plot holes, the poor writing style and lack of imagination this didn't intrigue me.=================The Characters:Heroine: Mari speaks many different languages and is a linguist, hence she picks up the Alien language very quickly. Her age wasn't really mentioned in the chapters I read, but the readers are informed on numerous occasions that she has vivid red hair (I assume she's a natural ginger sans freckles). She's defiant and originally challenges her captors. However, after the hero spares her, she's rather mellow and doesn't seem freaked out by being far away from earth and living in Alien territory.Hero: apart from being rather tall with cat like eyes, there's not much Alien about him that i could tell. Mari, the heroine describes him as resembling Native Americans, however, I've never seen bronze 7 feet Native Americans (the few I met were mixed heritage and resembled light-skinned Hispanic). He's rather mild, not the Alpha Male type. Basically, he's a tall, dark handsome cliche found in chick lit but with feline eyes. It's unfortunate the author didn't make him purple or blue skinned with horns on his head or something more imaginative. Tall, bronze skinned with long black hair reminds me of men I've seen from certain Middle Eastern countries and Punjab.================Plot holes:I'm not going to mention the glaringly obvious plot holes or I'll give away the story. However, a few are:1. The Alien species can speak English. Even the heroine points out that if one can converse with a species than it doesn't make much sense to allocate them as pets or food? The responding argument was not convincing enough to make this plot work. Even during the slavery trade - one of the reasons why slavers believed they were dealing with inferior species was because they believed the Africans they dealt with did not have a formal language or a proper culture.2. The Aliens believe that the humans are primitive and don't posses a proper culture. Considering that Earth has satellite it would be pretty easy for the Aliens to pick up a huge amount of data which would prove that humans have a form of electronic communication, entertainment and civilisation. The Aliens own form of living isn't very sophisticated hence I didn't understand why they thought they were so much more superior? I appreciate it might be a denial process (to justify the capturing of women) but again far too far fetched an argument. The Aliens technology such as their ""blackberry"" type hand held computer would be easily spotted by any number of aliens visiting earth.3. Considering the Aliens were suffering plagues and so forth - surely earth would have far more valuable possessions than human meat that would help them - additionally, you'd think they'd have sophisticated vaccinations or protective gear too.4. Mari manages to convince the Aliens within a space of a few minutes that she ought to be allowed to stay awake and engage in conversation with them. It seems that the aliens capitulated far too quickly. The story also jumps so one minute she's woken up and confronting them and the next minute we're told it's been a few days and they're impressed by her oddity.5. The Aliens do not look much different from many humans living on Earth. If they'd traveled to South East Asia, the Middle East or even the Far East they'd see beings much like them. Hence, their incredulity over Mari being able to engage in conversation with them is baffling. In fact even if they were to visit Norway or Iceland they'd find Viking like tall people (when I go there I feel like a munchkin and I'm 5.9). Hence, the story just wasn't convincing.I can't get into the reasons properly because I don't want to give away the story. I think it would be better if the Aliens found Mari in a primitive planet where her spaceship and stranded. The beings of that planet could be primitive but human physically and thus they mistaken her for one of them - when she's out bathing or something. She eventually slowly learns a few of their tongue and thus they are shocked by her even talking to them.================Summary of Plot:Mari (a human) was collecting eggs when she's captured by an Alien species with the intention to sell her at a meat market (humans are an expensive delicacy for certain species). The Aliens failed to tranquilize her properly and hence she wakes up to find herself naked and trapped in a cage on a cargo spaceship.She engages with her captors who are surprised by her ""intelligent"" form of interaction as they assume humans to be uncivilised and non-sentient beings. When they try to return her to hypersleep, she resists. Within the space of a few minutes and without much persuasion she manages to convince them to allow her to stay awake and in a page or two later she's managed to persuade the Hero that's she's not a pet or food.","08 29, 2013",A29I38KDR45ZLY,"Goddess of Blah Book Reviews ""Goddess of Blah""",1377734400

Troy Youngwolf has never stopped loving Breanna, but a youthful drunken mistake forced him to marry her best friend. Something that Breanna has never forgiven. But he's a widower now with a daughter and he's determined that Breanna give him another chance. Breanna can't wait for the wedding to be over so that she can get out of town as quickly as possible and away from Troy. Although she still has feelings for Troy, she can't get over his betrayal and no matter what he does or how he tries to explain, she simply wants to leave. Preferably before he breaks her heart again.I have to say, I usually really, really enjoy Elaine Hopper. As soon as this came across for review I wanted it. However Always a Bridesmaid left me feeling more frustrated than happy. I could have easily forgiven Troy his mistake but his late wife was such a cardboard character and the reasons beyond ""he was drunk"" were never really provided. So I never really felt that the book delivered the character depth that I needed to get past the betrayal and see him as hero material. Especially considering the way he just up and married without giving Breanna any warning. And without that depth I was frustrated by the constant barrage of characters who were on to Breanna to just forgive as if she was somehow in the wrong. Ms. Hopper still can put together a compelling storyline, but Always a Bridesmaid just missed the mark for me.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","05 25, 2010",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,1274745600

When she ends up in bed with Ross, her lifetime crush, it will have repercussions none of them counted on.Ross is handsome, sought after and has never had an inclination toward innocent young women.  For some unfathomable reason, Cassandra tempts him like no woman has before.  When he seduces her on a night of drunken stupor, he has no choice but to marry the alluring Cassandra.In a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.

This is my first male erotica by her and I was not disappointed.  This book is scorchingly intense from the word go. If your pulse isn't racing at the end of Chapter 1, you may want to check that you actually have one. Harlan, having exhausted all avenues to get his professor, Sawyer, to see him as anything but a student, sends him a sexy home video the very night he graduates.  Sawyer, having denied his feelings for years, finally admits defeat but has no interest in submitting quietly.  He's determined to show Harlan that the quiet, even keeled professor that Harlan has come to know is anything but laid back in the bedroom. Keep a cold drink closeby because you will need it. Once they give into their desires, the loving is hot and  heavy.  But in between the fiery sex scenes are two people overcoming societal labels(professor/student) and making missteps as they navigate their new relationship.  Harlan's job as an exotic dancer adds fuel to the fire and a whole different element to their relationship. This book is pretty much flawless, IMO. Be warned that there are some dom/sub elements here, but nothing too heavy.  Definitely one I will read again and again and again.","03 21, 2011",AS4402KIX1B34,Nile Princess,1300665600

Until late one night a massive car accident brings an unexpected but familiar patient, his ex-wife Lorna, into the E.R. Lorna, also a doctor, but a small town GP looking for a change, was in London applying for a hospital position. With no close friends or family in the city, and in no shape to make a long journey back to Scotland James takes Lorna into his home and personally takes over her care.Soon James and Lorna find themselves questioning the painful reasons that their brief marriage ended ten years prior. Will bringing up the old tragedy and hurt that strained their relationship to it's breaking point allow them to finally have closure, or will it bring them even closer?I really enjoyed this book. It was very sweet and thoughtful. I really liked all of the characters and felt that the author presented them in a way in which the read could commiserate with both parties.This book is very emotional, but for Lorna, the heroine, it was mostly internal meaning she refused to talk to the hero about issues that were essentially keeping them apart. This is really the only problem I had with the story, because it prolonged the outcome of the book, making it longer than necessary.","01 14, 2014",A15O0FDWIG133J,constantjoy,1389657600

She does not know it's him at first and does nothing but allow herself be thrown into a car with a hat over her head and tied at her neck and she makes no effort to yell, fight and get away! What an insult to women! Then she finds out it's Chay and she does nothing still? Please! She hasn't seen or spoken to this man in eight years! She makes no effort to get away when they stop at a hotel, no effort when they are at the store later, just complaining to the store owner she's been taken against her will, but let's the store owner dismiss it! And all the time in the cabin she complains but let's him get away with speaking to her with attitude when he is the one in the absolute wrong and acts like she doesn't have the right to be upset and mad. Hello?! He committed a federal offense! Not even to mention that he committed a wrong to her. And no one so much as tells him how wrong he is, just is like oh, it he's a good guy and they're sure her dad has his reasons? Pahlease! The story lacked true character and depth. It fell too short of reality. Yes it's a work of fiction, but it still needs to make sense and it is a story of real people, not an alternate world or paranormal scenario.

10591,B002DOSBOS,"[0, 1]",5,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 5/10PROS:- Anderson captures the annoying-yet-somehow-still-endearing antics of college boys quite well: the wrestling, the teasing, the constant put-downs, etc.- As much as I was annoyed at the two guys' refusal to just admit to their attraction for each other, I can't deny the fact that I snickered every time the phrase ""double dare extreme gay chicken"" (or something similar) came up.- There's a bit of angst, but it's the right amount for the story. It adds a bit of conflict without carrying on for too long.CONS:- Tall, burly men who play soccer are not entirely unheard of, but the majority of soccer players are average-sized or even smaller-than-average because there's such a call for speed and agility in the sport. The moment I read that our two heroes in this story are the stars of their college soccer team and are 6'4"" and 6'5"", I couldn't help rolling my eyes a bit at the impression of sensationalism I got. Add to that the fact that goalkeepers in soccer are generally referred to as ""keepers"" rather than ""goalies"" (as the story refers to them), and the entire setting lost its believability for me.- As soon as I lost the fight to prevent my eyes from rolling the first time, I was a goner. SO much about this story was silly to me: straight roommates who not only sleep in the same bed, but also cuddle, ""their bodies touching, their arms around each other""? Please. Guys who are so competitive that they'll go as far as kissing each other in a game of ""gay chicken"" just to prove how macho they are? Right.Overall comments: I would certainly pass on reading this ever again. It's not badly written; I just couldn't get past the premise. Every contrived situation the men found themselves in made me curl my lip yet again, and although I liked the protagonists okay, I was annoyed enough by their inability to admit their feelings that I didn't care too much about how things ended up.","06 11, 2012",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T.

This guy doesn't get the concept of ""Actions speak louder than words,"" or that maybe if your mate and all of your loyal friends tell you you're making a few mistakes you should listen to them. But nope, not our hero. He just doesn't comprehend why everyone doesn't just accept how absolutely right he is about everything. For someone chosen to be a member of an elite shifter version of Special Forces, this lack of judgment seems like a major liability.I did enjoy rolling my eyes at this guy's stupidity, as well as the appearances of the characters from previous books. On the down side, his ""little friend"" in this book (who pretty much derails his relationship,) also figures into the new series, Halle Shifters. I cringe to think that she will be an important character there, as she is selfish, immature and not at all likable. Unfortunately, she was given a ""special connection"" to a really great secondary character. What's with her and these ""special connections"" to the male characters? Maybe we'll get lucky and she'll mature some. Otherwise, I doubt the new series will be as enjoyable as the previous books.

No matter, she was just determined to save her dying friend, the dragon Reynor, and to do that she must engage the help of his Knight, Sir Kaden, or his love, the dragoness Linea.A waitress in a simple pub, Lucia certainly never expected to return to the tavern with two dragons, two Knights, and the Queen of Draconia herself in tow!  But it is just this troupe of heroes that arrive in time to help Reynor, for it is not just his body that is withering, but his spirit as well.It soon becomes clear to Knights Kaden and Marcus that Lucia is their mate, fated to complete the union between dragons and knights and round out their family.  But Lucia isn't from Draconia, and while she has heard rumor of the strange custom in which two Dragon Knights must marry one woman, she is uncertain she can go through with it...If you have read many of my reviews, it is no secret to you that I am a huge fan of author Bianca D'Arc, and most especially her Dragon Knights stories.  You can imagine my pleasure that she continues to imagine new stories for this fascinating series, and that she seems to have no trouble finding ways to keep the stories fresh and exciting, as proven once more with the newest edition in the saga, Wings of Change.With this new story, we enjoy a return to the m&eacute;nage theme that began the series.  This scenario guarantees some built-in angst for the story as Lucia tries to come to terms with the idea of mating with two men, a situation beyond her experience or the societal norms of her own country.  But Kaden and Marcus are more than up to the task of convincing her that their love is true and right, with a little help from Marcus' dragoness, the Lady Linea.Of course, the relationship between these three isn't the sole focus of D'arc's book - she fleshes it out nicely with some long-hidden secrets about Lucia, some of which she herself is hiding, and a few of which have been long hidden from her.  As we learn Lucia's secrets, we see that she may very well be a most important figure in the future of the war between Draconia and Sskithdron.The author introduces us to yet another most intriguing new species, something I believe I'm becoming rather spoiled on!  As a long-time lover of Fantasy stories, my excitement with the introduction of each new creature builds more and more, expanding not only the horizons within this world, but my interest as well.Wings of Change is the fifth story in the Dragon Knights series, and will be released in print in the future anthology, I Dream of Dragons I.

There was also a short review column on mystery blogs and a meaty, interesting book review column.  The issue was rounded out by a nice reproduction of the print edition's cover, two cute poems (crime-oriented, of course), and announcement of the magazine's 2007 Reader Awards.At the end of each story, one is given the option to jump back to the table of contents to select another story, but I chose to just sail right through and read the whole edition ""cover to cover"".

10614,B000FC1BN8,"[1, 1]",5,"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).","09 24, 2010",A3SZMGJMV0G16C,"Andrew Pruette ""Rancors Love to Read""",1285286400

I loved the characters, especially the Hob even though he wasn't mentioned all that much. The only issues I saw in the book were small, like Leo called Mandy Megan in one part. Just small, but not enough to through off the reader. That's ignoring the fact that they go on like bunnies during what is happening to his brother.

6150,B002YNSBLG,"[0, 0]",5,"For the record: I like spanking romances.  I'm not one of those people who reads one and doesn't know what she's getting into.This historic novel is what is called magical realism.  It is set in the real world but has magical elements.  I like magical realism.I went back and forth on liking this one.  I feel like a lot of these novels are really anti-women's rights.  I do not think that historic novels or DD (domestic discipline) romances have to disregard women as intelligent creatures so much.  I do not think that BDSM, DD and all of that has to disregard feminism.  In fact, in real life it rarely does and if it does it should be avoided.The fact that the main character is a strong woman who was born in the wrong time is fine.  It makes sense that she would be beaten every time she expressed an opinion.  It was awesome that she was so strong and capable but still feminine.  I liked that she was able to earn some respect.The things that bothered me about this book were these:-The men in it were unrealistic pigs.  They did not act like gentlemen would have acted at the time.  A man of that time would have acted like a gentleman in public and the fact that he was chastising a woman would not have been publicized like it is in this novel.-Her brothers were abusive monsters.-The men acted like the main character was some horrible brat when all they needed to do was reason with her.  Seriously, a polite explanation as to why she shouldn't do something would have gone a long way.  In fact, some politeness somewhere, anywhere in the book would have been appreciated.-When she proved herself they still refused to allow her some leeway.-All the men were bullies except one and he didn't get the girl.-The characters were all fairly unlikable.  If I'm going to read a cheap romance novel I want to like the characters.  The point of cheap romance novels is wish fulfillment.  Literary fiction is for disappointment.-The men in this story at some point just decided that they would be unreasonable for no reason.  The author was using those instances to get to the next spanking scene.  However, it made it really hard to like the male characters.-The main character was smart but acted like a moron.  At some point she needed to figure out how to act and how to get her way.-At one point the main male character lied to the heroine and tricked her.  Then acted like he was in the right.-The thing that bothered me the most was that at the end the heroine tried to implement a change that would have advanced women's rights.  She was beaten by her husband until she promised to recant that move.  Of all people her husband should have supported her.  What she was asking for was not unreasonable and the king was willing to grant it.Anyway, if all you read these for is the sex and the spanking scenes you will enjoy it.  If you actually want to read a decent story look elsewhere.","05 8, 2014",A2F94O49MX43RH,Leslie Jones,1399507200

How hard would it have been for the author to put an a few lines of English/American Medical glossary in the back explaining the difference between a Doctor versus a Mister?  Apparently both are medical professionals of some distinction in a London hospital, but I couldn't make heads or tails out of it.  The story was based in a hospital and I couldn't separate the story from the setting, so I was constantly being distracted by uncommon terms.With regard to the love story, I felt the ten year span was too long for the separation, but I understand it was needed for them to establish their careers.  Too many things happen in 10 years - people settle for things and move on - I felt this was too pat of a story.

And killing off one of my favorite characters (whose own romance I would have liked to have seen turn happily-ever-after) just killed the whole book for me.","02 16, 2012",A3HZ3VGIA8MZTL,Amazon Customer,1329350400
